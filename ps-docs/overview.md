# Project “Sophia” overview (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

Project “Sophia” is a new generation of AI-first business app that helps users with complex, cross functional tasks, and offers a new way to discover, visualize, and interact with business data.

Project “Sophia” offers an AI- powered, user-friendly research canvas and large language model powered [blueprints](#blueprints). The research canvas helps you create exploratory journeys and understand business data with AI-generated charts and insights without the need to manually mine data and create visuals. The app provides quick insights and recommends the next steps. You can start with a question and explore different options and can continue to iterate until you get the best possible outcome.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Project “Sophia” is available only in the European Union (EU) and United States region.
> - While Project "Sophia" is based on large language models that work with multiple languages, the product has been validated only in the English (United States) language. Other languages are currently not supported.
> - This is a preview feature. Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - By accessing or using the Project “Sophia”, you accept the [Microsoft Preview Terms of Service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2242556).
