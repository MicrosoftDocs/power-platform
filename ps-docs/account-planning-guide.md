Its purpose is to assist users who are unsure where to begin by providing guidance on which data to use for optimal results. The data indicator shouldn't be viewed as the sole source of data or the only data that should be provided.

1. Go to [https://projectsophia.microsoft.com]( https://projectsophia.microsoft.com).
1. From the **Home** screen, select **Guides** > **Account planning**.
1. To get relevant results, select **Domains** located at the top right and choose a specific domain.
1. Select **Add data** and then select one of the following options:
   - Connect to data from **Dataverse**, or **Dynamics 365 Sales**
   - **Upload files**
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > You need to have an account with the data source to establish a connection to it. For more information, go to [Connect to your data](data-connections.md).
