# Frequently asked questions about Project "Sophia" (preview)

[This article is prerelease documentation and is subject to change.]

## Why can't I access Project  "Sophia"?
Project "Sophia" is only available in the  European Union (EU) and United States. If you're trying to access it while you're in the  European Union (EU) or United States and still get a notification stating **Project Sophia is not yet available your region**, then it's because the data residency of the tenant you're trying to access Project "Sophia" from is based outside of the European Union (EU) or United States. You can sign up for product news and to be notified when Project "Sophia" is available in new regions [here](https://aka.ms/projectsophianews). 

## Can I provide feedback to the product team?
Submit your feedback on Project â€œSophia" [here](https://aka.ms/projectsophiafeedback).

## Why do I get an error when trying to upload a file?
You can upload a PDF (.pdf), CSV (.csv), and Excel (.xls) file. For more information, go to [Uploading files](data-connections.md#uploading-files).

## The page never loads when I select next actions:
This might happen if you select multiple **next actions** while a previous next action is loading. We're aware of the issue and are working on a fix in an upcoming release, but until then select **cancel** and try the action again.

## How can I refine a single block instead of the entire blueprint?
If you're using the AI Cursor and press enter after entering your prompt, your prompt will automatically create a new blueprint. To update only a single block on a blueprint, select **Generate** and then select **Generate in place of existing block**.

## Can I connect to data instead of uploading files? 
Yes, you can connect to Dataverse, and Dynamics 365 Sales to analyze your data. For more information, go to [Connect to your data](data-connections.md).
We plan to support connecting to more enterprise data sources in upcoming releases.

## What are the preview terms? Is Microsoft using my data to train their models? How do I know my data is safe?

The use of Project "Sophia" is subject to the terms outlined in [Preview terms](https://aka.ms/projectsophiapreviewterms).
