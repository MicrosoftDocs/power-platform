# Experience Optimization design principles

The following design principles are intended to provide guidance for aspects of Experience Optimization that you should consider throughout the development life cycle. Start with the recommended approaches and justify the benefits for a set of requirements. After you set your strategy, drive actions by using the [Experience Optimization checklist](./checklist.md).

## Design for the user

| ![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Put the user at the center of your workload experience design. |
|--|

Strive to understand the needs, experiences, expected outcomes, and desires of the users of your workload, and tailor the design of the workload to the users' specific requirements.

| Approach | Benefit |
|--|--|
| Learn about what users want, need, and struggle with through user research and empathy-building methods. Imagine yourself as a user to understand their experiences and views, guiding design choices that meet their needs well. | Insights inform design decisions and ensure that the workload addresses users' real-world challenges effectively.<br><br>Workload experiences are tailored to users' workflows, mental models, and preferences, resulting in more relevant and user-centric designs.<br><br>The workload resonates with users on an emotional level, leading to higher levels of user satisfaction and engagement.<br><br>You find creative and innovative solutions that address users' needs and overcome usability barriers. |
| Include users in every stage of the design process, making users the main drivers of decision-making. Design solutions that match user objectives, processes, and ways of thinking, making sure that users can perform tasks quickly and easily.|Users are more likely to enjoy using the system and see its benefits if they feel that the system meets their needs well and isn't difficult to use.<br><br>When users perceive the workload as user-friendly and useful for their needs, they're more likely to adopt it and use it regularly in their daily work. This perception results in higher levels of user engagement and usage, contributing to the success of the system.<br><br>Experiences that are easy to use minimize the need for extensive training and support. When users can easily comprehend and operate the system, you can save time and resources on training programs and user support. |
 | Design experiences that are inclusive and suit users with different backgrounds, cultures, and contexts. Think about factors like language, cultural expectations, and digital skills, to ensure that interfaces are easy to use and meaningful for everyone. | Your workload can be used by people with different abilities, including people with disabilities.<br><br>You anticipate and accommodate evolving user needs and technologies with a flexible and adaptable experience. |
| Maintain consistency in design and functionality across different platforms and devices. Design interfaces that adapt seamlessly to different screen sizes, resolutions, and input methods, providing users with a consistent experience regardless of the device they use. | Users have a consistent and functional experience with your workload across their different devices and platforms. |

## Design for simplicity

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Make the workload easy to use. Minimize complexity and ensure a user-friendly experience.|
|--|

Simplicity helps users learn the system, perform their tasks, and achieve their goals with minimal distractions.

| Approach | Benefit |
|--|--|
| Create a coherent and logical structure of information, content, and functionality in the interface. | Users quickly understand the interface and are able to locate the functionality relevant to their tasks.<br><br>Users can process information more efficiently and make informed decisions without being overwhelmed.<br><br>Streamlined interactions are more accessible and ensure that users can navigate the interface more effectively. |
| Provide an intuitive and consistent interface that follows relevant design conventions and standards. Take advantage of existing mental models and expectations of the users. | Users can easily figure out how to use the workload without spending excessive time or effort in learning new interactions or workflows. This faster learning speeds up user onboarding and adoption.<br/><br/>Users have a feeling of consistency as they experience design elements and interactions they recognize and have used before. This consistency lowers mental effort and makes it simpler for users to comprehend and navigate the interface.<br/><br/>There is uniformity across interfaces, both within and across workloads. Uniform design elements and interactions facilitate the learning and usage of the interface for users, regardless of their prior experience. |
| Focus on the most important information and actions. Eliminate any elements, features, or fields that aren't needed. | Users access and consume information effectively, resulting in better-informed interactions and improved satisfaction.<br/><br/>Users find the system easy to use and are more likely to engage with the workload, leading to higher adoption rates and better utilization. |

## Design for efficiency

|![Goal icon](../_images/goal.svg) Reduce friction and streamline the user experience. |
|--|

Design the workload to make it easy for users to accomplish tasks efficiently, with minimal frustration. Ensuring that users are able to get their work done increases their satisfaction and realizes higher return on investment (ROI).

| Approach | Benefit |
|--|--|
| Design workflows and processes to be straightforward and intuitive. Minimize the number of steps required to complete tasks. | Users accomplish more in less time.<br/><br/>The risk of errors is reduced, leading to improved accuracy and reliability.<br/><br/>Operational expenses are lowered through efficiency improvements. |
| Optimize interaction design to reduce the time and effort required for users to perform common actions, such as filling out forms or making selections. | Users complete the objectives more quickly.<br/><br/>Task completion rates go up and the need for user support goes down.<br/><br/>Users feel a greater sense of satisfaction and accomplishment. |
| Provide clear and consistent feedback. Inform users about the status, results, or errors of their actions; use progress indicators for long-running tasks; and acknowledge user input promptly. | Users understand what is happening, monitor their progress, and recover from errors.<br/><br/>Users know that the system has seen and handled their actions, making them more trustful of the interface.<br/><br/>Users feel more at ease when they get instant feedback, knowing that their input has been accepted.<br/><br/>Users move through complex processes or new interfaces with assurance.<br/><br/>Error messages provide instructions or suggestions for corrective actions, helping users troubleshoot problems efficiently. |
| Prioritize tasks and features based on user needs and frequency of use, ensuring that commonly performed actions are easily accessible and efficient to execute. | Task prioritization helps users concentrate on the most important and effective activities, minimizing interruptions and mental stress. Clear prioritization directs users to the actions that have the most impact, simplifying their workflow and improving their overall experience.<br/><br/>Putting the most important tasks first helps users see more clearly the actions they need to take. Users can choose faster and with more confidence, leading to less time spent on decisions and better usability.<br/><br/>Workload teams can use resources wisely by working on tasks or features that benefit users the most. Workload teams can increase the effect of their efforts and resources, leading to better results and ROI. |
