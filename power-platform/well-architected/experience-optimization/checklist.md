| &#9744; | [XO:02](design-standards.md) | **Follow established standards, conventions, and guidelines**. Use common design patterns. Maintain consistency in design elements, terminology, and interactions across the interface. Use consistent patterns and standards to guide users through the interface and create a cohesive user experience. |
| &#9744; | [XO:03](information-architecture.md) | **Implement a consistent information architecture**. Be consistent in navigation structures. Provide contextual clues and visual indicators to guide users. Use consistent and user-friendly labels for categories, navigation, and other informational elements. |
| &#9744; | [XO:04](usability.md) | **Prioritize ease of use during the design process**. Minimize user effort and maximize task efficiency. Streamline complex processes. Align design decisions with user needs. |
| &#9744; | [XO:05](feedback-guidance.md) | **Provide meaningful, useful, and simple guidance** in notifications and messages. Notify users with relevant, important, and valuable information. Give users feedback on their actions and let them know when something happens and what they need to do next. |
