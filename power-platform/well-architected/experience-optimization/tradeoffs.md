# Experience Optimization tradeoffs for Power Platform workloads

During the design phase of a workload, it's important to consider how decisions based on the [Experience Optimization design principles](./principles.md) and recommendations in the [Design review checklist for Experience Optimization](./checklist.md) might influence the goals and optimization efforts of other pillars. Certain decisions may benefit some pillars, while being tradeoffs for others. This article lists example tradeoffs that a workload team might encounter when designing workload architecture and operations for Experience Optimization.

## Experience Optimization tradeoffs with Reliability

> :::image type="icon" source="../_images/trade-off.svg"::: **Increased complexity**. A workload that uses straightforward approaches and limits customization is generally more reliable.

- Continuous improvement through adding new features in the user experience can introduce new issues that affect reliability and require thorough testing.

- Customizing the user interface with code and components adds new reliability targets.

## Experience Optimization tradeoffs with Security

> :::image type="icon" source="../_images/trade-off.svg"::: **Increased workload surface area**. The Security pillar prioritizes a reduced and contained surface area to minimize attack vectors and the management of security controls.

- Improving the experience with features and integrations can introduce potential vectors for attack.

- Using code components can inadvertently increase the workload's attack surface.

## Experience Optimization tradeoffs with Operational Excellence

> :::image type="icon" source="../_images/trade-off.svg"::: **Compromised resource capacities**. A workload's operational process provides rigor, consistency, specificity, and prioritization to change management in a workload.

- Customizations in the workload's experience can complicate maintenance efforts and require increased resource utilization for testing.

- Allocating resources to perform user research and develop prototypes can impact the focus on operational activities.

## Experience Optimization tradeoffs with Performance Efficiency

:::image type="icon" source="../_images/trade-off.svg"::: **Decreased performance.** Performance Efficiency prioritizes platform features over customization to achieve efficiency and effectiveness.

- Customizations in the workload's experience can have a negative impact on performance.
