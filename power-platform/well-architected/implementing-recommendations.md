# Complete a Power Platform Well-Architected assessment

[Power Platform Well-Architected Review](https://aka.ms/powa/assessment) is a self-assessment that can help a workload team examine a workload from the perspective of  Power Platform Well-Architected. It consists of questions that are based on the key recommendations provided in the pillars of Power Platform Well-Architected. 

At the end of the assessment, you get recommendations and corresponding links to supporting material that can help you improve your workload's design. You can export these recommendations into a file that you can use to incorporate the recommendations into the operational processes for continuous workload improvement.

## When to take the assessment

For greenfield workloads, we recommend that you perform the assessment during the initial design process, entering the proposed decisions. The guidance then acts as a baseline and starts a feedback loop that you can use to refine the workload design as you make additional design decisions and periodically capture them in additional assessment milestones.

Brownfield workloads should be examined as well, as part of the continuous improvement cycle of the workload. Set a cadence, for example, every three months, and use milestones to track how the workload design can continue to improve.

## Receive and integrate recommendations

Assess your workload by completing the assessment. The recommendations for your current milestone are available on the assessment's guidance page. Export these recommendations by selecting the **Export to CSV** button. You can use the offline copy to share the recommendations and start to prioritize them. Although some teams might consider the CSV file sufficient, we recommend that you add the recommendations to the workload's backlog so they can be integrated into the workload's software development lifecycle (SDLC).

## Prioritize and implement recommendations

Workload owners and key stakeholders should prioritize the recommendations in accordance with the team's standard work prioritization process, factoring in the applicability of the recommendations and any tradeoffs associated with a specific design decision. For example, recommendations might be assigned to a specific owner, or a recommendation might be postponed or dismissed. Like all planned work, the recommendation should be tracked until it's resolved, as part of the workload's SDLC.

## Monitor improvements

Over time, the workload will evolve due to functionality changes, eliminating or accruing technical debt, and making tradeoffs. Use the milestone feature of the assessment to track this change over time, using the prior milestone as a baseline. You'll see the change over time in the [Power Platform Well-Architected Review](https://aka.ms/powa/assessment).

## Tips

- You should always sign in when you take assessments so that the tool can generate milestones.

  > [!WARNING]
  > Assessments are tied to a Microsoft Learn profile. They can't be transferred to or accessed by other profiles.

- Choose a meaningful name for the assessment, not the default value. The assessment's name should include the workload's name.
- Use meaningful milestone names to indicate when you're evaluating the workload.
- Use the notes feature on questions and on recommendations to capture any specifics that you want to discuss with the workload team.
- Rather than answering all the questions across all five pillars in one assessment, consider taking the assessment one pillar at a time, staggered by month. Be sure to include the name of the pillar in the assessment's name.

## Get personalized support

Work with your [Microsoft partner](https://appsource.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partner-dir) or your account team to learn how they can help you perform an assessment as a formal engagement. As part of that engagement, they can provide further details on the recommendations. These details can help you determine the applicability of recommendations and how to prioritize them for remediation.
