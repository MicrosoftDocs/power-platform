## Power Platform Well-Architected

[Power Platform Well-Architected](/power-platform/well-architected/) is a set of best practices, architecture guidance, and review tools to help you make informed decisions when you're designing, planning, and implementing modern application workloads with Power Platform. It's separate from but complementary to the architecture center.

Use Power Platform Well-Architected to evaluate and align your decisions with design principles across these five key architectural pillars:

- [Reliability](/power-platform/well-architected/reliability/)
- [Security](/power-platform/well-architected/security/)
- [Operational Excellence](/power-platform/well-architected/operational-excellence/)
- [Performance Efficiency](/power-platform/well-architected/performance-efficiency/)
- [Experience Optimization](/power-platform/well-architected/experience-optimization/)

Evaluate the trade-offs between these architectural pillars to create a design that meets business requirements and is durable, maintainable, secure, and scalable.
