## Workflow

This section outlines the step-by-step process followed in the CardioTriage-AI workflow.

1. **Patient registration and check-in**:
    - A front desk interactive agent (built using Microsoft Copilot Studio) guides the front desk staff or patient through registration.
    - At check-in, the agent generates an Outpatient (OP) ticket and records patient information in Microsoft Dataverse.
    - The triage process starts and creates a unique case identifier for tracking.
1. **Lab report submission and data extraction**:
    - A lab technician or patient uploads the diagnostic lab report through the CardiaLite Power Apps interface.
    - AI Builder automatically extracts relevant health metrics (like troponin levels and ECG values) using pre-trained form processing models.
    - The system validates and securely stores extracted values in Dataverse, updating the patient record in real time.
1. **Autonomous triage trigger**:
    - When the lab report is submitted successfully, a Power Automate flow starts automatically.
    - This flow activates the Triage Master Agent, an autonomous AI agent designed using Copilot Studio, which starts the triage evaluation.
1. **AI-powered data evaluation and triage decision-making**:
    - The triage master agent evaluates the patient's lab data by referencing the following:
        - Intelligent cardiac triage guidelines, to assess criticality and risk.
        - Intelligent clinic scheduling guidelines, to determine if a consultation is necessary and what expertise is required.
    - The agent optionally calls the Microsoft Graph API to get physician availability and contextual data (like prior appointments).
    - Based on the outcome, the case is categorized as critical, non-critical with follow-up, or monitor-only.
1. **Automated appointment scheduling**:
    - If a physician consultation is recommended, the system books an appointment using Microsoft Bookings, matching patient urgency with the relevant cardiologist's availability.
    - Booking details sync with Outlook calendars for both patients and doctors.
1. **Real-time notifications**:
    - Patients get immediate notifications of the triage outcome through Outlook email.
    - If a consultation is booked, the email includes the time, doctor name, and location or link.
    - If no immediate action is needed, the email provides personalized health tips or follow-up reminders.
    - The system logs all interactions and outcomes for transparency and auditing.
