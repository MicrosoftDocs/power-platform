# Manage Power Platform solution performance

Performance refers to how quickly and reliably your solution works, including apps, flows, tables, and other aspects. If your solution is slow, crashes often, or doesn't work as expected, users can become frustrated and stop using it. Good performance helps ensure that users finish tasks smoothly and encourages them to keep using your solution.

Careful planning, testing, and monitoring keep users engaged and productive.

## Plan

When you plan your solution, think about how many people will use it at the same time and how much data it's expected to handle. Consider how parts of your solution, like apps, flows, and tables, work together and with external systems. Poorly managed connections or inefficient designs can slow down your solution or cause unexpected problems. Planning ahead helps you choose the right tools and designs for real-world use.

## Test

Test your solution regularly to maintain good performance. Check how your solution behaves under different conditions, such as when many users access it simultaneously or when it processes large amounts of data. Regular testing during development helps you find and fix performance issues early, before users notice.

## Monitor

Monitor your solution's performance after it goes live. Use monitoring tools to track how quickly apps load, how long flows run, how well tables handle data, and how often errors occur. Tracking these details helps you identify issues early and improve your solution so it runs smoothly.

## Summary

Focus on performance from the start and keep improving it to provide users with a better experience.  Good performance leads to happier users and helps your solution succeed as it evolves. Careful planning, regular testing, and consistent monitoring ensure your solution remains fast, reliable, and scalable.
