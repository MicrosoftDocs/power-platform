# Measure and maintain Power Platform solution performance

This article gives an overview of key tools for monitoring and optimizing Power Platform solution performance. Each tool has unique features that help you diagnose issues, analyze usage patterns, and make sure your apps, flows, and data services run efficiently. Depending on the business criticality or risk of a solution, you use a different mix of tools to help prevent potential issues. Learn more examples in the `Recommendations across solution complexity` section below.

## Monitoring and reporting tools and processes

Use these essential tools to monitor and report on the performance of your Power Platform solutions.

### Power Apps Checker

Power Apps Checker is a built-in tool in Power Apps Studio that identifies potential performance, accessibility, and formula issues in canvas apps. It gives immediate feedback on areas that can affect app responsiveness or user experience, so you fix problems before deployment.

To use Power Apps Checker, open your app in Power Apps Studio and select the **Apps Checker** icon (stethoscope icon) from the toolbar. The tool shows a list of issues by severity, with explanations and recommendations for fixing each issue. Regularly review and address these findings to keep your apps fast and user friendly.

### Power Apps Monitor

Power Apps Monitor is a diagnostic tool that shows how your canvas apps perform in real time. It captures detailed telemetry as you use your app, including control rendering, data calls, errors, and network activity. This helps you find where slowdowns or failures happen, whether they're caused by slow data sources, inefficient formulas, or network issues.

To use Power Apps Monitor, open your app in Power Apps Studio and select **Monitor** from the toolbar. This opens a separate window where you run your app and watch as events are logged live. You see a timeline of actions and select each event for more details. 

Reviewing this data helps you determine which parts of your app need optimization and take action to improve performance.

### Power Automate Analytics

Power Automate Analytics gives a dashboard view of how your automated workflows (flows) perform over time. It tracks metrics like the number of successful and failed runs, average execution times, and error details. This helps you see not just if your flows work, but how efficiently they run and where they can get stuck.

To access these analytics, go to your flow in Power Automate and select **Analytics**. Review charts and tables that highlight trends and patterns, like recurring failures or slow steps. Analyzing this data helps you find bottlenecks, optimize flow logic, and keep your automation reliable and responsive.

### Dataverse Analytics

Dataverse Analytics gives insights into the underlying data platform used by many Power Platform solutions. It shows metrics on data storage, API usage, and query performance, helping you see how your solution interacts with its data sources. This helps you find slow queries, excessive data operations, or potential capacity issues.

Access Dataverse Analytics in the Power Platform admin center by selecting your environment and going to the **Analytics** section under Dataverse. You find dashboards and reports that break down usage patterns and performance statistics. Monitoring these metrics lets you address issues before they affect users, like optimizing queries or managing data growth.

### Azure Application Insights

Azure Application Insights is a monitoring service that integrates with Power Platform solutions, especially those using custom connectors, plugins, or Azure services. It collects telemetry data like user interactions, response times, exceptions, and dependency calls, giving a complete view of your app's health and performance.

To set up Application Insights, create an instance in the Azure portal. Then, configure your Power Platform solution or related components to send telemetry data to itâ€”this can involve adding instrumentation code or setting up connectors. After setup, use the Application Insights dashboard to visualize trends, set up alerts, and drill into specific issues. This helps you keep your app performing well and quickly fix problems.


### Solution Checker

Solution Checker is a built-in tool in Power Platform that scans your solutions for common performance, reliability, and security issues. It analyzes your customizations like plugins, workflows, and configurations and gives a report with actionable recommendations to improve efficiency and compliance with best practices.

To use Solution Checker, go to your solution in the Power Apps portal, select **Solution Checker**, and run the analysis. The tool generates a detailed report highlighting issues and suggesting fixes, like optimizing queries or refactoring code. Regularly run Solution Checker to catch potential problems early and keep your solutions of high quality.

### Performance testing and benchmarking

Performance testing simulates real-world usage of your Power Platform solution to see how it behaves under different conditions, like multiple users or large data volumes. This helps you find how your solution scales and where it can struggle as demand increases. Benchmarking compares your solution's performance against predefined standards or previous versions to measure improvements or regressions.

Run performance testing manually by having users do typical tasks and measuring response times, or use automated tools to simulate load and capture metrics. Regular testing and benchmarking help keep your solution responsive and reliable as it evolves, and provide concrete data to guide optimization.



### Distributed tracing

Sometimes, a performance issue can be spread across services or buried deep within service calls, making it hard to trace and only happening intermittently with no clear pattern. Implement distributed tracing so when issues happen, you have the telemetry you need to find and fix the problem.

## Recommendations across solution complexity

When evaluating Power Platform solutions, it's helpful to classify them into three tiers of complexity: Low risk, Medium risk, and High risk. Each tier reflects the potential impact and technical sophistication of the solution, with Low risk solutions being simple and personal, Medium risk involving moderate business impact or integration, and High risk encompassing mission-critical or highly integrated systems. As the complexity increases from Low to High risk, the requirements for monitoring, testing, and optimization become more stringent, ensuring that each solution receives the right level of attention and best practices to match its importance and potential risks.

> [!NOTE]
> These recommendations across risk categories are one example; your context may require you to make changes to best fit your needs.

### All, low-risk, or personal productivity solutions

When trying to implement any standards across every app and solution in your tenant it's best to stick to tools that don't require any additional permissions or additional bookmarks if possible.

Determine what items that are flagged by the Power Apps Checker that are OK to ignore and which should be cleared, document those recommendations, and promote that knowledge within your internal Power Platform community.

We recommend ensuring that Inefficient delay loading within the Apps Checker is cleared entirely. Inefficient delay loading means that your app has cross-screen references, most likely with a control property, referring to a control on another screen. This most often occurs when copying and pasting a control from one screen to another. When this happens, this causes Power Apps to load that second screen in order to show the current screen. If that second screen has a similar issue, then it may need to load a third screen, and so on.

This can quickly become a tangled web of references that are hard to undo if they aren't handled as you go. To remedy these issues, insure that any shared values between screens are stored as variables, collections, or named functions.

In addition, any instances of delegated queries or accessibility issues should be considered and minimized where possible to ensure that your app will continue to run, even as data use and your userbase changes over time.

### Medium-risk solutions

In addition to the items in the "all" category, medium risk solutions need to keep a closer eye on potential issues that can arise as the size of the solution data grows over months and years, and ensure that you're gathering enough of the right data to ensure that you can react quickly to issues, and know where to make improvements to increase the business value achieved with your solution.

Tools like **Power Apps Monitor**, **Power Automate Analytics**, and **Dataverse Analytics** will best help provide valuable insights that help you clearly see how your Power Platform solutions are performing.

Together, these tools help you pinpoint what's working well and where improvements can be made, enabling you to proactively optimize your solutions for better performance, reliability, and user satisfaction.

### High-risk solutions

In addition to the tools in the low and medium-risk sections, high risk and/or high business criticality solutions need to enable the teams that support these apps, the developers that react quickly to fix issues that pop up, and enable your organization to reach their business goals with data and reporting metrics to support them. Performance plays a key role in this process, as any app that is perceived as slow, as taking too long, or otherwise as a roadblock to a business process will quickly find itself disused and abandoned by its user base.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid traditional load-testing methods that rapidly send large numbers of requests directly to Power Platform services, as this can trigger platform throttling and negatively impact your testing results. Instead, consider approaches such as:
> - Gradually ramping up user interactions to simulate realistic usage patterns.
> - Using multiple test accounts or identities to distribute load evenly.
> - Leveraging automated UI testing tools that mimic actual user behavior at realistic intervals.
>
> These methods help ensure accurate performance insights without violating platform usage policies or encountering throttling limits.
