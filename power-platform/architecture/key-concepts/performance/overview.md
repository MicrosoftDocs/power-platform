# Manage Power Platform performance

Performance means how quickly and reliably your solution works, including apps, flows, tables, and other parts. If your solution is slow, crashes often, or doesn't work as expected, users get frustrated and stop using it. Good performance lets users finish tasks smoothly and encourages them to keep using your solution.

When you plan your solution, think about how many people use it at the same time and how much data it handles. Consider how parts of your solution, like apps, flows, and tables, work together and with external systems. Poorly managed connections or inefficient designs slow your solution or cause problems. Planning ahead lets you pick the right tools and designs for real-world use.

Test your solution regularly to keep good performance. Check how your solution works under different conditions, like when many users use it at once or when it processes lots of data. Regular testing during development lets you find and fix performance issues early, before users notice.

After your solution is live, keep monitoring its performance. Use monitoring tools to track how quickly apps load, how long flows run, how well tables handle data, and how often errors happen. Watching these details lets you find issues early and improve your solution so it runs smoothly.

Focus on performance from the start and keep improving it to give users a better experience. Good performance makes users happier and lets your solution grow. Careful planning, regular testing, and consistent monitoring keep your solution fast and reliable.
