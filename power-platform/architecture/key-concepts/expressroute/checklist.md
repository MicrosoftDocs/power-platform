# Checklist for ExpressRoute readiness

Use the following checklist to help you determine whether your organization is ready to implement ExpressRoute for Power Platform.

## Client routing

The use of ExpressRoute for Power Platform and Microsoft 365 requires routing traffic from the client through the ExpressRoute circuit rather than over the internet.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Are clients configured to use a proxy to route traffic to the ExpressRoute subnet rather than across the internet?
> * Are clients connecting from a public IP address, or are they hidden behind network address translation?
> * Are clients able to connect through the internet for non-private resources, such as Azure Content Delivery Network?

## WAN performance

When you use ExpressRoute, client performance is only as good as the slowest link on the connection. Because most clients connect to the ExpressRoute circuit through a wide area network (WAN), the capacity and speed of the WAN connection are critical.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Are the capacity and speed of the WAN connection sufficient for the traffic it will handle?

## Peering

Power Platform uses Microsoft peering.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Have you configured Microsoft peering appropriately for your needs?

## Asymmetric routing

[Asymmetric routing](planning-expressroute.md#avoid-asymmetric-routing) can cause firewall and other network issues.

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Have you configured the network and ExpressRoute to ensure that you avoid asymmetric routing?

## Geographical distribution

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * If your users are distributed geographically, have you considered how to optimize the ExpressRoute circuit connectivity?  
> * Have you determined whether multiple circuits should be distributed geographically for different areas or regions?

## On-premises integration

> [!div class="checklist"]
>
> * Are connections from the Microsoft Cloud to the on-premises network across ExpressRoute protected as if they came from the public internet?
