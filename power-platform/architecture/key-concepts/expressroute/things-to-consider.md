# Things to consider before using ExpressRoute with Power Platform

The complexity of setting up ExpressRoute is often underestimated. In particular, the following actions and implications are often overlooked, either in planning or execution:

- Configuring your network to route traffic to the subnet connected to ExpressRoute

- Avoiding asymmetric routing, where traffic goes directly to Power Platform across the internet but is returned by ExpressRoute to the corporate network, triggering rejection of the traffic by the firewall

- The overall costs of provisioning ExpressRoute, including Microsoft Azure services, connectivity provider provisioning, and ongoing service and internal IT network routing configuration

- Determining whether multiple ExpressRoute circuits should be established for distributed deployments  

## Connectivity performance issues

When using ExpressRoute, it's important to understand the connectivity performance issues that can arise. These issues can be caused by several factors.

### LAN connectivity

Some of the common issues a user might experience are:

- Connectivity within the local network is already saturated before adding a rich browser application to the mix.  
- Power Platform is replacing a thick client application where only the data was transmitted across the network, rather than both data and presentation information.

It's important to understand that a browser application, while requiring less client-side deployment administration, requires higher bandwidth than a thick client application. An already saturated local network might experience additional strain with new services.

### Poor WAN connectivity

Network analysis of connectivity to the online service shows that network traffic often traverses an internal network route, which adds significant latency. This situation happens due to conditions such as:  

- Saturation of the WAN link.
- Proxy processing, incurring more latency and overhead 
- Inefficient internal routing (for example, routing within the corporate network rather than routing out to the internet earlier)

If Power Platform traffic suffers from those challenges, performance at the client might also suffer.

### Poor internet connectivity

Adding cloud services can introduce extra consumption and load on the corporate connection to the internet. This can happen if:

- The internet connection isn't sufficient to support the additional load.  
- Within the internet service provider's (ISP)'s network, the routing of that traffic to Microsoftâ€™s network is controlled by the ISP&mdash;the efficiency of that routing can vary.  
- The connection suffers from a mix of traffic, which affects the quality of the connection (for example, multiple internet-based training sessions, Microsoft Stream, or YouTube videos with traffic to a business-critical application competing for the available bandwidth). This might be sufficient for the traffic volume but might affect performance during demand peaks, such as those introduced by video streaming.

You can address these issues by getting additional bandwidth or separate connections through the ISP. A separate connection dedicated to priority traffic can help improve both the performance and predictability of the traffic.

Ensure that you set up Quality of Service (QoS) correctly. If you're using Microsoft Teams and Microsoft Stream, refer to the [QoS requirements within ExpressRoute](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-qos). 

## Security control

The next configuration to consider is the security control.

ExpressRoute itself doesn't encrypt or filter traffic natively (with the exception of [ExpressRoute Direct with MACsec enabled](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-about-encryption)). It simply establishes a private, rather than shared, connection directly between the Microsoft and customer datacenters through their connectivity provider.

Any request from any Microsoft online service or Azure service to the subnet advertised through an ExpressRoute circuit will be routed via that circuit, regardless of the service or customer. Because the request routes at the network layer, there's no application-level control to check if the requester is appropriate for the destination service.

Traffic to Microsoft services uses public shared services, which can be accessed directly over the public internet. Application-level authentication and authorization control access to these services. Infrastructure-level protections guard against intrusion and threats like denial-of-service attacks.  

For traffic from Microsoft services to on-premises hosted services, the customer is responsible for providing similar protection to their own services when traffic is received across an ExpressRoute connection.

## Ability to restrict ExpressRoute use to only certain Microsoft services

One of the challenges you might face is wanting to use ExpressRoute for a particular Microsoft cloud service but not for others. Although the different peering options provide some level of control, the peering itself doesn't provide granular control within services of the same peering type (for example, to enable routing only to Azure virtual machines but not to Microsoft 365). It's possible, however, to use Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) communities to configure traffic for specific services only.

This is relevant for Power Platform services with a Microsoft 365 presence, where routing via ExpressRoute might be desirable for one service but not for both, or only for certain individual services of Microsoft 365 such as Microsoft Teams.

ExpressRoute itself doesn't currently offer the ability to directly configure services to be routed via a specific ExpressRoute circuit at this level of service granularity. However, you can use BGP communities to control this.

Microsoft advertises routes in the Microsoft peering paths with routes tagged by using appropriate BGP community values for geographical locations and service types. These can then be configured in the customer's routers to route traffic for those services through the ExpressRoute circuit.

You can use different [tags for Microsoft 365 services](/microsoft-365/enterprise/bgp-communities-in-expressroute) to route traffic only for those services through the ExpressRoute circuit, and route the rest either across a different ExpressRoute circuit or the public internet.

Power Platform-specific BGP community values aren't available like they are for Microsoft 365 services. Instead, [regional BGP communities](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-routing#bgp) are used with corresponding Microsoft Azure regions that are used for each Power Platform environment. Because Power Platform environments use two sets of datacenters, be sure to check the [Regions overview](/power-automate/regions-overview) to identify which two datacenters are used. Learn more in [BGP communities for GCC](/azure/azure-government/compare-azure-government-global-azure#azure-expressroute).

### Microsoft 365

Because Power Platform services and Microsoft 365 services are both offered through Microsoft peering, setting up Microsoft peering would by default advertise all Power Platform services and Microsoft 365 services across the ExpressRoute circuit.

Enabling BGP communities to route traffic for one service would lead to both being routed across ExpressRoute. This can have unfavorable results. For example, if you determine the network bandwidth needed for Power Platform and size the ExpressRoute connection accordingly, but inadvertently route all your Microsoft 365 traffic via ExpressRoute, you can saturate your network and cause performance challenges.

While enabling ExpressRoute for Microsoft peering will route all Power Platform and Microsoft 365 traffic through the ExpressRoute connection, it's possible to use BGP community tags to control the routing so that only specific services&mdash;such as Power Platform services but not other Microsoft 365 services&mdash;use the ExpressRoute connection. Not all Microsoft 365 services are designed to work with ExpressRoute. Currently, Power Platform services don't have a designated BGP community like [some Microsoft 365 services do](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-routing#service-to-bgp-community-value). Instead, you should use [regional BPG communities](/azure/expressroute/expressroute-routing#bgp) to match with the region where the [Power Platform environment](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview) was created.

Learn more about routing Microsoft 365 in [selective routing with Microsoft 365](/microsoft-365/enterprise/azure-expressroute).

Because Power Platform services work partially as part of the Microsoft 365 service, many crossover services such as the admin portal and authentication are also required. It's not possible to protect all of these services by using ExpressRoute&mdash;the Microsoft 365 admin center, for example, isn't published across ExpressRoute.

## Support for sovereign clouds

Customers required to meet government or country/region-specific regulations can choose to use a sovereign cloud. Sovereign clouds are physically located in a region to meet the requirements specific to that particular government or country. For example, Power Apps for Government Community Cloud (GCC) is located in the United States, where it meets US governmentâ€“specific regulations and certifications and satisfies protocols to meet those requirements.

Watch this video describing how Power Platform is available with sovereign clouds: [Video: Sovereign Clouds with Marty Carreras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMg3uQ5EFLI).

When you consider using a sovereign cloud environment, you must consider what limitations exist, because not all features are available when compared with public cloud environments. The availability by each environment for Power Platform is listed in the following table. Learn about other differences in availability in [Power Automate regions](/power-automate/regions-overview).

| **Region**                                    | **ExpressRoute support** |
|-----------------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| US Government Community Cloud (GCC)           | Supported <sup>1</sup>  |
| US Government Community Cloud High (GCC High) | Supported <sup>1</sup>  |
| China                                         | Supported <sup>2</sup>  |

<sup>1</sup> Customers must use Azure Government ExpressRoute when using US GCC or GCC High regions, and can't use Azure commercial cloud ExpressRoute.  
<sup>2</sup> Customers must use Azure China ExpressRoute when using China regions, and can't use Azure commercial cloud ExpressRoute.  

## Azure ExpressRoute costs

When estimating the costs for ExpressRoute, you need to consider several elements:

- Azure costs  
- Connectivity provider costs  
- Internal setup effort costs  

To determine the business case accurately, consider all these costs when evaluating ExpressRoute for Power Platform. The following sections discuss each cost.

### Azure costs

- Azure ExpressRoute can be purchased in different models.  

- Billing Type  

  - Metered: A base subscription cost per month with unlimited inbound traffic but a per-GB charge for outbound traffic  
  - Unlimited: A base subscription cost per month with unlimited inbound and outbound traffic  

- SKU / Plan  

  - Standard  

    - Basic connection using ExpressRoute  
    - Offers access to services within a single geographical region  
    - If the ExpressRoute circuit is within the same region as the Power Platform environment that users are connecting to, only ExpressRoute standard is required for that circuit  

  - Premium  

    - Offers access to worldwide geographical services from wherever the connection is made  
    - If a user connects through an ExpressRoute circuit from a different region than their end service, they'll require ExpressRoute Premium for that ExpressRoute circuit.

### Connectivity provider costs

In some cases, the costs of establishing the connection with the connectivity provider can be significant. These are separate from the Azure costs for ExpressRoute.

### Internal customer effort to configure the network routing

To enable ExpressRoute, the network routing must be set up internally.  

For many customers, this requires an internal cross-charge to the network team, an external cost to an IT outsourcing provider, or at least an opportunity cost for the efforts of internal staff to focus on the configuration.

## Impacts to existing Power Platform, Microsoft 365, and Azure services in use

When you enable Microsoft peering, traffic for Power Platform services, Microsoft 365, and Azure is routed via ExpressRoute.

If you're already using either Power Platform, Dynamics 365 applications, or Microsoft 365 without ExpressRoute, it's important to be sensitive to the impact on these existing services when you enable Microsoft peering through ExpressRoute (which is the default behavior). It might be necessary to configure routing by using BGP communities to separate traffic to different services.

## Reusing ExpressRoute across multiple online services

A single ExpressRoute connection can be used to access multiple online services; for example, Power Platform, Dynamics 365, Microsoft 365, and Azure.

:::image type="complex" source="media/reuse-network.png" alt-text="Diagram showing a shared ExpressRoute connection with Microsoft public services and Azure.":::

:::image-end:::

ExpressRoute itself doesn't separate different types of Microsoft services from a particular subnet. It's possible to use BGP community tags to control the routing of traffic to particular services across ExpressRoute. Microsoft doesn't route traffic back across ExpressRoute selectively based on BGP community tags. If traffic needs to be returned differently based on the service type, make sure that the traffic comes from different public IP addresses. Because traffic returning to a subnet is handled at the network level, configuring only some traffic from a subnet to use ExpressRoute is dangerous and can lead to asymmetric routing.
