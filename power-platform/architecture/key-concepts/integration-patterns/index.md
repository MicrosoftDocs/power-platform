# Design scalable integrations with Power Automate

Integration is a critical aspect of modern business processes, enabling seamless data flow and automation across different systems. This section provides a structured approach for designing robust, scalable, and cost-effective integrations using Power Automate cloud flows. It outlines key integration requirements, common patterns, real-world examples, and strategic considerations to help you make informed decisions aligned with enterprise goals.

This section is intended primarily for enterprise architects involved in designing new or optimizing existing system integrations using Power Automate low-code solutions.

You'll learn:

- How to deconstruct requirements into the key components of an integration
- Who to include as stakeholders in the decision-making process
- How to choose the best pattern for your goals
- How to balance scalability and performance
- How to use the strengths of cloud flows and address their shortcomings
- Techniques for robust integrations

## Next step

Before exploring individual integration patterns, it’s important to understand the foundational considerations that shape every integration design decision.
