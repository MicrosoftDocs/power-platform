# Integration patterns

Based on your analysis, the next step is to plan the integration and identify the best integration pattern based on your requirements. The following list of integration patterns is by no means exhaustive. At the very least, you might find that a combination of these patterns best fits for your specific scenario. 

Each pattern addresses specific business scenarios and technical constraints:

- [Instant user action](#instant-user-action): This pattern reflects how users interact with systems. A user-driven action triggers a predefined series of actions. 
- [Event-driven (automatic)](#event-driven-automatic): This pattern requires an automatic trigger, such as a response to events happening in a given system.
- [Data consolidation](#data-consolidation): This pattern is essential for organizations with multiple management systems that require a complete picture of their data across their various systems. 
- [Service-oriented architecture](#service-oriented-architecture): This pattern typically involves multiple flows across systems, enabling modular, scalable integration in complex environments.
- [Synchronization](#synchronization): This pattern keeps data in sync across different databases and addresses performance and regulatory requirements.
