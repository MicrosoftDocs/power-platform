# Power Platform Well-Architected pillars and data migration

Data migration is a critical step in modernizing business systems and ensuring seamless operations. The [Power Platform Well-Architected](../../../well-architected/what-is-power-well-architected.md) framework provides proven guidance to help you plan and execute workloads that are reliable, secure, and efficient. This article outlines the key benefits of following Power Platform Well-Architected pillars for data migration, including improved reliability, enhanced security, operational excellence, performance efficiency, and optimized user experience. 

## Reliability

The defined data migration architecture ensures reliability by incorporating several key strategies. Running a virtual machine in the same region as Dataverse minimizes latency and maximizes data transfer speeds, helping to ensure that the migration is efficient and less prone to interruptions. A high-memory, high-storage virtual machine&mdash;like the D4 with 8 cores, 28 GB RAM, and 500 GB storage&mdash;handles large volumes of data without performance degradation. Using a local database instead of an Azure database improves reliability because it reduces dependencies on external services and avoids potential connectivity or service outages. Deploying Azure Data Factory in the same region as Dataverse ensures consistent and rapid data processing. 

The architecture provides a robust, dependable data migration process with minimal downtime, swift error handling, and a streamlined recovery strategy.

- **Design for business requirements**

    Design for business requirements by considering the needs of the data migration. After segmenting data, talk with each business stakeholder about migration needs to bring in only relevant data. Add columns like `Processing Flag`, `Action Flag`, and `DM Created Date Time` to monitor the progress of data migration at a granular level.

- **Resiliency**

    Build a failover mechanism and handle errors immediately for every table to keep migration resilient. Keep error and success tables to give a clear picture of successful and failed records.

- **Recovery**

    Plan the recovery process for any data migration. Store data in intermediate staging databases so you can take full database backups at regular intervals to recover if the system fails or crashes. If you keep only tools at the application layer, it's hard to recover and find the current state of migration if the application fails. Running failed records is easier with a separate intermediate database.

- **Self-support**

    A clear schema and systematic approach help team members support each other. If a key team member is on vacation, others can check the status of individual tables and the current migration set to understand the current situation.

- **Simplicity**

    The architecture is simple and reliable. Any data migration developer can learn and implement it after learning the approach.

## Security

Security is critical in data migration architecture. Protect sensitive information throughout the migration process by using robust encryption mechanisms for data in transit and at rest. Carefully define access controls, and grant permissions only to authorized people to reduce internal risks. Run regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to find and fix potential risks. Use real-time monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to suspicious activity promptly. Follow industry standards and best practices to keep the migration environment secure from both external and internal threats, thereby maintaining integrity, confidentiality, and availability of the data during and after the migration.

- **Security readiness**

    For Dataverse data, security depends on ownership, business units, and security roles. Use disabled users as stubs and assign them a minimum privilege security role, like the "salesperson" role. Keep data secure at the source by storing it in a virtual machine or database with limited access.

- **Protecting confidentiality**

    Follow strict ownership rules for data. Assign owners to the right business units and security roles to protect data confidentiality. Keep data records confidential from source to target. To prevent developers from seeing sensitive data, use masked data for migration jobs in lower environments. Run migration jobs in a separate environment with help from business users.

- **High availability**

    Dataverse is an SaaS (software as a service) platform that guarantees high availability of data and the system. During migration, use an intermediate database with regular backups to ensure high availability and prevent data loss.

- **Maintaining security**

    After migration, keep security intact by making sure ownership migration isn't changed. Discard the intermediate staging database after you validate the migration.

## Operational Excellence

Operational excellence is achieved through a combination of meticulous planning, continuous improvement, and adherence to best practices. The architecture is designed to ensure that data is migrated efficiently and securely while maintaining high levels of performance and reliability. Regular audits and assessments help identify areas for improvement, allowing for the refinement of processes and the implementation of innovative solutions. Advanced technologies and methodologies help ensure that the migration process is streamlined, reducing downtime and minimizing disruptions to business operations. Additionally, the architecture includes robust monitoring and alerting systems that provide real-time insights into the migration process, enabling immediate response to any issues that might arise. This proactive approach ensures that the migration is completed on time and within budget, while also meeting the highest standards of quality and security.

- **Embrace fusion development**

    Fusion development principles foster a collaborative environment where developers, IT professionals, and business users work together. This approach promotes rapid development and deployment of migration solutions that are tailored to meet the specific needs of the organization. Low-code platforms and tools empower business users to contribute to the migration process, reducing the dependency on IT resources and accelerating the overall timeline. This collaborative model ensures that all stakeholders are aligned, and that the migration strategy is executed effectively.

- **Establish development standards**

    Strict development standards ensure consistency and quality across all migration projects. These standards include guidelines for coding practices, documentation, testing, and validation. Following these standards helps ensure that the migration is predictable, repeatable, and scalable. This structured approach reduces the risk of errors and enhances the overall reliability of the migration. Additionally, standardized development practices facilitate better communication and collaboration among team members, leading to more efficient and effective project execution.

- **Improve operations with monitoring and insights**

    Advanced monitoring and analytics tools provide real-time insights into the migration process. These tools track key performance indicators (KPIs) and generate detailed reports on the progress and status of the migration. Continuous monitoring of the environment helps to quickly identify and address any potential issues before they escalate. This proactive approach minimizes downtime and ensures that the migration is completed smoothly. Furthermore, the insights gained from monitoring help inform future migration projects, enabling continuous improvement and optimization of processes.

- **Deploy with confidence**

    The data migration architecture is designed to instill confidence in the deployment process. Rigorous testing and validation procedures are implemented to ensure that all migrated data is accurate, complete, and functional in the target environment. The process includes unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing. Thoroughly validating the data and systems before deployment minimizes post-migration issues and helps ensure a seamless transition for end users. This comprehensive approach to validation and deployment provides peace of mind to stakeholders and guarantees the success of the migration project.

- **Automate for efficiency**

    Automation in the data migration architecture drives efficiency and reduces human error. Automated scripts and workflows handle repetitive tasks such as data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL), as well as validation and testing. Automation not only speeds up the migration process but also ensures consistency and accuracy, and frees up valuable resources to focus on more strategic activities, such as process optimization and stakeholder engagement. Automation tools also make it easier to scale and manage larger, more complex migration projects.

- **Adopt safe deployment practices**

   Safe deployment practices protect the integrity and security of data. These practices include implementing robust backup and recovery procedures, conducting thorough predeployment testing, and ensuring that all changes are thoroughly documented and reviewed. A phased deployment approach means changes are rolled out gradually to minimize risk and allow for easy rollback if issues are encountered. Prioritizing safety and security in deployment practices helps guarantee a smooth migration process and the protection of data.

## Performance Efficiency

Advanced monitoring and analytics tools optimize the migration process for speed and reliability. These tools track key performance indicators (KPIs) like data transfer rates, system resource utilization, and error rates. Continuous monitoring helps to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks in real time, ensuring that the entire migration process runs smoothly and efficiently. Automated scripts and workflows minimize human intervention, lower the risk of errors,  and improve overall performance. Meticulous attention to performance metrics not only ensures a successful migration but also lays the groundwork for future optimization.

- **Realistic performance**

    Realistic performance in data migration is achieved by setting attainable performance goals based on thorough analysis and testing. The data migration architecture considers the constraints and capabilities of the source and target environments to define achievable performance benchmarks. This approach keeps the migration process within system resource limits, avoids overloading, and prevents failures.
