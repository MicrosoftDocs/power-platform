# Power Platform Well-Architected pillars and data migration

Data migration is a critical step in modernizing business systems and ensuring seamless operations. The [Power Platform Well-Architected](../../../well-architected/what-is-power-well-architected.md) framework provides proven guidance to help you plan and execute workloads that are reliable, secure, and efficient. This article outlines the key benefits of following Power Platform Well-Architected pillars for data migration, including improved reliability, enhanced security, operational excellence, performance efficiency, and optimized user experience. 

## Reliability

The defined data migration architecture is reliable because it uses several key strategies. Running a virtual machine in the same region as Dataverse reduces latency and increases data transfer speeds. This setup makes migration efficient and less likely to be interrupted. Also, a high-memory and high-storage virtual machine, like the D4 with 8 cores, 28 GB RAM, and 500 GB storage, handles large volumes of data without performance issues. A local database instead of an Azure database further improves reliability because it reduces dependencies on external services and avoids potential connectivity or service outages. Deploying Azure Data Factory in the same region as Dataverse keeps data processing consistent and fast. This architecture gives you a robust and dependable data migration process with minimal downtime, fast error handling, and a simple recovery strategy.

- **Design for business requirements**

    Design for business requirements by considering the need for data migration. After segmenting data, talk with each business stakeholder about migration needs to bring only relevant data. Add columns like `Processing Flag`, `Action Flag`, and `DM Created Date Time` to monitor the progress of data migration at a granular level.

- **Resiliency**

    Build a failover mechanism and handle errors immediately for every table to keep migration resilient. Keep error and success tables to give a clear picture of successful and failed records.

- **Recovery**

    Plan the recovery process for any data migration. Store data in intermediate staging databases so you can take full database backups at regular intervals to recover if the system fails or crashes. If you keep only tools at the application layer, it's hard to recover and find the current state of migration if the application fails. Running failed records is easier with a separate intermediate database.

- **Self-support**

    A clear schema and systematic approach let team members support each other. If a key member is on vacation, others can check the status of individual tables and the current migration set to understand the current situation. This architecture supports self-service.

- **Simplicity**

    This architecture is simple and reliable. Any data migration developer can learn and implement it after learning the approach.

## Security

Security is critical in data migration architecture. Protect sensitive information throughout the migration process by using strong encryption for data in transit and at rest. Carefully define access controls, and grant permissions only to authorized people to reduce internal risks. Run regular security audits and vulnerability assessments to find and fix risks. Use real-time monitoring and alerting to detect and respond to suspicious activity quickly. Follow industry standards and best practices to keep the migration environment secure, and maintain data integrity, confidentiality, and availability during and after migration.

- **Security readiness**

    For Dataverse data, security depends on ownership, business units, and security roles. Use disabled users as stubs and assign them a minimum privilege security role, like the "salesperson" role. Keep data secure at the source by storing it in a VM or database with limited access.

- **Protecting confidentiality**

    Follow strict ownership rules for data. Assign owners to the right business units and security roles to protect data confidentiality. Keep data records confidential from source to target. To prevent developers from seeing sensitive data, use masked data for migration jobs in lower environments. Run migration jobs in a separate environment with help from business users.

- **High availability**

    Dataverse is a SaaS platform that guarantees high availability of data and the system. During migration, use an intermediate database with regular backups to ensure high availability and prevent data loss.

- **Maintaining security**

    After migration, keep security intact by making sure ownership migration isn't changed. Discard the intermediate staging database after you validate the migration.

## Operational Excellence

Operational excellence in our data migration architecture is achieved through a combination of meticulous planning, continuous improvement, and adherence to best practices.
