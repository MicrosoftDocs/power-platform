# Achieve excellence in CRM migration: real-world Dataverse insights

Dataverse data migration lets you move data from different CRM systems into Microsoft Dataverse. This process helps keep your operations running smoothly. Moving data from external CRM systems like Salesforce or Siebel into Dataverse can be challenging. Differences in data schema, volume, complexity, and dependencies in the source systems cause issues. Keep your data accurate, consistent, and secure during migration to maintain business continuity.

Some common issues during migration include:

1. **Data mapping and transformation**: Source and target data structures often differ. Mapping and transforming data to fit Dataverse schemas takes time and can cause errors.

1. **Data volume**: Large data sets slow down migration, so plan carefully to handle high volumes.

1. **Data quality**: Duplicates, missing fields, or inconsistent formats in source systems affect the integrity of migrated data.

1. **Integration of dependencies**: Relationships between entities, lookups, and other data dependencies need careful handling to keep everything working in Dataverse.

1. **Performance and downtime**: Large or complex migrations cause downtime or slow performance, which affects business operations.

1. **Security compliance**: Handle sensitive data securely to meet data protection rules and policies.

The migration approach depends on the size and complexity of your data set. Use a simple, medium, or complex approach based on volume and complexity.
