# CRM migration to Dataverse: Key insights and best practices

Migrating data from external customer relationship management (CRM) systems to Microsoft Dataverse can range from simple to highly complex, depending on the source data. Success depends on thorough planning and preparation to address common challenges such as schema mismatches, data volume, relationship complexity, and system dependencies. Maintaining data integrity, consistency, and security is essential to ensure business continuity.

Common migration challenges to address include:

- **Data mapping and transformation**: Source and target schemas often differ. Allocate time for mapping, transformation, and validation. Identify and exclude nonessential data early.
- **Data volume**: Large datasets can strain performance. Plan for scalable processing and consider segmenting data.
- **Data quality**: Incomplete, inconsistent, or duplicate data can compromise integrity. Include validation and cleansing steps in your migration workflow.
- **Relationship dependencies**: Carefully manage lookups and table relationships to preserve functionality in Dataverse.
- **Performance and downtime**: Complex migrations can slow systems or cause downtime. Identify bottlenecks early and optimize your approach to reduce impact.
- **Security and compliance**: Ensure sensitive data complies with organizational policies. Include validation and protection steps in your migration process.

Choose your migration strategy based on data size and complexity. This guide categorizes migrations as simple, medium, or complex and offers best practices to help you plan and execute a successful transition to Dataverse.

> [!NOTE]
> This example assumes that process analysis and solution evaluation have already been conducted, and that Dataverse has been identified as the appropriate destination for the data. Teams should always assess whether a first-party application, such as Dynamics 365 Finance & Operations (F&O),  better aligns with business needs before proceeding with custom implementations in Dataverse.
