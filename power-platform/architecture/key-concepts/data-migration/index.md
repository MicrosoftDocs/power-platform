# CRM migration to Dataverse: Key insights and best practices

The migration of data from external customer relationship management (CRM) systems into Microsoft Dataverse can vary in complexity depending on the source system data. Upfront planning and preparation can optimize your migration process, enabling you to mitigate some of the challenges proactively. Challenges can include differences in data schema, volume of data, complexity of relationships, and dependencies in the source systems. Ensuring data integrity, consistency, and security throughout the migration process is crucial for maintaining business continuity.

The following are some of the common challenges to handle as part of proper preparation:

- **Data mapping and transformation**: Source and target data structures often differ significantly. Mapping and transforming data to fit Dataverse schemas require adequate time and validation to avoid errors. It is also important to identify data that does not need to migrate.

- **Data volume**: Large data sets can strain the migration processes. Careful planning can help you handle high volumes effectively.

- **Data quality**: Duplicates, missing fields, or inconsistent formats in source systems can affect the integrity of migrated data. Ensuring your migration workflow includes proper validation steps and data transformations can help improve the quality of the data you migrate to Dataverse.

- **Integration of dependencies**: Relationships between tables, lookups, and other data interdependencies need careful handling to maintain functionality within Dataverse.

- **Performance and downtime**: Large or complex migrations can cause prolonged downtime or slow system performance, potentially impacting business operations. By identifying complexities early, you can implement strategies as part of your migration process to help mitigate and reduce your migration processing timeline.

- **Security compliance**: Any Sensitive data you migrate needs to follow your organization's protection rules and policies. Migration workflows must include steps to ensure compliance while also ensuring proper data validation occurs.

The migration approach you should use depends on the size and complexity of your data. To help you identify your situation, this article categorizes migrations into simple, medium, or complex based on volume and complexity. This article provides key insights and best practices to help you plan and execute a successful migration from external CRM systems, such as Salesforce or Siebel, to Microsoft Dataverse.
