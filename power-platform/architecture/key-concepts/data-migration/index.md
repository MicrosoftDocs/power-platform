# CRM migration to Dataverse: Key insights and best practices

Data migration is the process by which data is transferred from one system to another. This article provides key insights and best practices to help you plan and execute a successful migration from an external customer relationship management (CRM) system to Microsoft Dataverse.

The migration of data from external CRM systems like Salesforce or Siebel into Dataverse is complex. Challenges include differences in data schema, volume, complexity, and dependencies in the source systems. Ensuring data integrity, consistency, and security during the migration process is critical to maintain business continuity.

Common issues during migration include:

- **Data mapping and transformation**: Source and target data structures often differ significantly. Mapping and transforming data to fit Dataverse schemas is time-intensive and error-prone.

- **Data volume**: Large data sets can strain migration processes. Plan carefully to handle high volumes effectively.

- **Data quality**: Duplicates, missing fields, or inconsistent formats in source systems can affect the integrity of migrated data.

- **Integration of dependencies**: Relationships between entities, lookups, and other data interdependencies need careful handling to maintain functionality within Dataverse.

- **Performance and downtime**: Large or complex migrations can cause prolonged downtime or slow system performance, which may affect business operations.

- **Security compliance**: Sensitive data must be handled securely to meet data protection rules and policies.

The migration approach depends on the size and complexity of your data set. Use a simple, medium, or complex approach based on volume and complexity.
