We'll continue to add patterns over time in collaboration with the Power Platform community.

## Follow Power Platform Well-Architected

You can evaluate any Power Platform workload's design and implementation through various lenses. Use [Power Platform Well-Architected](/power-platform/well-architected/) to evaluate and align your decisions with design principles across these five key architectural pillars:

- [Reliability](/power-platform/well-architected//reliability/)
- [Security](/power-platform/well-architected//security/)
- [Operational Excellence](/power-platform/well-architected/operational-excellence/)
- [Performance Efficiency](/power-platform/well-architected/performance-efficiency/)
- [Experience Optimization](/power-platform/well-architected/experience-optimization/)

By following these principles and evaluating the tradeoffs between these architectural pillars, you can produce a design that meets business requirements and is sufficiently durable, maintainable, secure, and scalable.
