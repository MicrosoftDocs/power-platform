# Contribute to Power Platform and Copilot Studio Architecture Center

At Microsoft, the team turns internal notes, years of experience, and different documents into comprehensive architecture guidance. But Microsoft isn't the only source of expertise on using Power Platform and Copilot Studio. The community includes people who are experts in different aspects of implementation. If you have a reference architecture, a pattern, or a solution idea that works well across several implementations, share it here on Microsoft Learn to help the community work more productively and efficiently in their projects.

## How to contribute

To contribute a new article to the Dynamics 365 architectural guidance, follow these steps:

1. Register your work by submitting a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPnPGuidanceHub/issues/new?template=new_architecture_submission.yml) to contribute a pattern to the Architecture Center. This step reduces the risk that another contributor is working on the same architecture.
1. Use the Microsoft Word templates in the [templates/architecture folder](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPnPGuidanceHub/tree/main/templates/architecture) in the GitHub repository to capture your contribution. The folder also has a PowerPoint template to help you design diagrams. You can also use Visio or another design tool.
1. Attach the files to your GitHub issue and change the label to *ready for review* when you want to submit a new article. You can add your LinkedIn profile to be listed as the original author in the *Contributors* section of the article.
1. Microsoft reviews the article, lets you know if there are any questions, and publishes it.

> [!TIP]
> You can also contribute by submitting a content request. Submit a new [content request issue](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPnPGuidanceHub/issues/new?template=contentrequest.yml) on GitHub. This feedback is reviewed regularly and helps plan future documentation improvements. Not all content requests are implemented, but priorities depend on current work and available tools.

## What to contribute

Contribute architectural guidance, like solution ideas and design patterns. If you have a best practice or reference implementation, open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPnPGuidanceHub/issues/new?template=new_architecture_submission.yml) to submit your proposal.

- **Reference architectures**: Reference architectures describe a solution architecture and suggest best practices for a specific scenario. This guidance aligns with [well-architected design principles](/power-platform/well-architected/). It doesn't include code. The template is based on the [Azure Architecture Guide template](/contribute/content/architecture-center/aac-contribute).
- **Solution idea**: Solution ideas summarize the overall architecture with images, components, and flows. These articles are brief and aren't based on proven guidance. The goal is to help readers explore solution possibilities on Power Platform and Copilot Studio. Solution ideas describe small architectures for Power Platform and Copilot Studio. The template is based on the [Azure Architecture Guide template](/contribute/content/architecture-center/aac-contribute).
- **Key concepts**: A generalized architecture pattern that acts as a core architecture with a common solution that applies to many scenarios. Use this type for content that provides design patterns used in architecture. The article must include context and problem, solution, issues, and considerations, but doesn't follow a template. Review [existing key concepts](key-concepts/index.md) and submit your document with your own structure and headers.

## Contributor recognition

The Contributors section lists key contributors by name and links to their LinkedIn profiles. The following screenshot shows an anonymized version of the *Contributors* section in an [Azure Architecture Center article](/azure/architecture/guide/multitenant/approaches/governance-compliance#contributors). If you provide your LinkedIn profile when you submit a contribution, you're listed as a contributor.
