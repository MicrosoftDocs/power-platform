# Contribute to Power Platform and Copilot Studio Architecture Center

At Microsoft, we're working to transform our internal notes, years of experience, and various documents into comprehensive architecture guidance. But we at Microsoft aren't the only experts on how to implement solutions with Power Platform and Copilot Studio. The community includes people who are experts at various aspects of implementation. Do you have a reference architecture, a pattern, a solution idea that works well across several implementations? Consider sharing it here on Microsoft Learn to make the whole community even more productive and efficient in their projects.

## How to contribute

To contribute new articles to the Dynamics 365 architectural guidance, follow these main steps:

1. If you want to contribute by raising a content request, submit a new [content request issue](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPnPGuidanceHub/issues/new?template=contentrequest.yml) on GitHub. We triage this feedback regularly and use it to plan for future documentation improvements. Not all content requests are implemented, but we'll prioritize based on current work priorities and the tooling available.
1. To contribute to the Architecture Center, first register your work by submitting a new [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPnPGuidanceHub/issues/new?template=new_architecture_submission.yml).  This will reduce the risk that someone else is working on the same architecture.
1. The GitHub repo contains Word templates that you can use to capture your contribution. All Word templates are in the [templates/architecture folder](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPnPGuidanceHub/templates/architecture). The folder also contains a PowerPoint template that can help you design the diagrams you need. Alternatively, use Visio or another designer.
1. When you're ready to submit a new article, attach the files to your GitHub issue and change the label to *ready for review*. Optionally, add your LinkedIn profile so that you can be listed as the original author in the *Contributors* section of the article.
1. Microsoft will review the article, let you know if there's any questions, and work on the publishing of the article.

## What to contribute

We welcome contributions of architectural guidance, including solution ideas and design patterns. If you have a best practice or reference implementation, submit your proposal either to us via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerPnPGuidanceHub/issues/new?template=new_architecture_submission.yml).

- **Reference architectures**: Reference architectures describe a solution architecture and suggested best practices for a specific scenario. The guidance is aligned to [well-architected design principles](/power-platform/well-architected/). It doesn’t have accompanying code. The template is based on the [Azure Architecture Guide template](/contribute/content/architecture-center/aac-contribute).
- **Solution idea**: Solution ideas summarize the overall architecture with image, components, and flows. These articles are brief and aren’t based on proven guidance. The intent is for readers to explore solution possibilities on Power Platform and Copilot Studio. Solution ideas are small architectures of Power Platform and Copilot Studio implementations. The template is based on the [Azure Architecture Guide template](/contribute/content/architecture-center/aac-contribute).
- **Key concepts**: A generalized architecture pattern that acts as a core architecture with a common solution that applies to many scenarios. Use for content that provides design patterns used in architecture. The article must include context and problem, solution, issues and considerations but do not follow a template. Review our [existing key concepts](key-concepts/index.md) and submit your document with your own structure and headers.

## Contributor recognition

The Contributors section lists key contributors with their name and a link to their LinkedIn. The following screenshot is an anonymized version of the *Contributors* section in an [Azure Architecture Center article](/azure/architecture/guide/multitenant/approaches/governance-compliance#contributors). By providing your LinkedIn profile when you submit a contribution, we will list you as a contributor.
