# Microsoft Dataverse reference architectures and solution ideas

Microsoft Dataverse is a software as a service (SaaS) data platform that's easy to use and easy to manage. Dataverse works with any type of data and any type of app. As the data foundation of Power Platform, Dataverse requires no or little coding, so everyone from knowledge workers to professional developers can work with it. Because it's built on Microsoft Azure, Dataverse is globally available, scalable, compliant, and secure.

Understanding reference architectures and exploring solution ideas can help you unlock new opportunities for automation, optimization, and innovation in your organization. In this article, we look at:

- **Key concepts:** Learn about key architecture concepts that help you build robust, efficient, and maintainable solutions with Dataverse.

- **Reference architectures:** Explore foundational reference architectures that support building well-architected solutions with Dataverse, including best practices for scalability, security, and performance.

- **Solution ideas:** Discover a range of solution ideas that demonstrate the versatility and power of Dataverse.
