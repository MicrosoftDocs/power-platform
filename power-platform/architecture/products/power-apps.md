# Power Apps reference architectures and solution ideas

Microsoft Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, and connectors, as well as a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for your business needs. Using Power Apps, you can quickly build custom business apps that connect to your data stored either in the underlying data platform ([Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro)) or in many online and on-premises data sources (such as SharePoint, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and SQL Server).

By understanding reference architectures and exploring solution ideas, you can unlock new opportunities for automation, optimization, and innovation within your organization.

In this article, we look at:

- **Key concepts:** Learn about architecture key concepts that help you build robust, efficient, and maintainable solutions with Power Apps.
- **Reference architectures**: Explore foundational reference architectures that support building well-architected solutions with Power Apps.
- **Solution ideas**: Discover a range of solution ideas that demonstrate the versatility and power of Power Apps.

## Key concepts

| Title | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[Distributed tracing across multiple services](../key-concepts/distributed-tracing.md)** | Learn how to achieve observability across services like Power Platform, Azure, and Dynamics 365. |
| **[Coding guidelines](/power-apps/guidance/coding-guidelines/overview)** | Learn about standards for naming objects, collections, and variables, and guidelines for developing consistent, performant, and easily maintainable apps. |
| **[Build large and complex canvas apps](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-large-apps)** | Use the recommendations in this article to better work with large and complex apps in Power Apps Studio and improve your apps' runtime performance. | 
| **[Optimize app or page load for peak performance](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/fast-app-page-load)** | One of the key factors that shape a user's perception of an app is how quickly it opens and becomes functional. Follow the guidelines in this article to achieve fast data loading apps. | 
| **[Optimized query data patterns](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/optimized-query-data-patterns)** | Learn about ways to optimize how to query data quickly. | 
| **[Small data payloads](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/small-data-payloads)** | Learn how to limit the size of the data you fetch into Power Apps. | 
| **[Fast calculations](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/efficient-calculations)** | Power Fx expressions are powerful and do many background calculations for you automatically. While Power Fx automates many things for you, it's possible to fine-tune your calculations so they are as fast as possible. | 
| **[Troubleshoot Power Apps canvas app performance issues](/troubleshoot/power-platform/power-apps/canvas-app-performance/troubleshoot-perf-table)** | Identify common performance issues you might encounter while using a canvas app, along with likely causes and recommendations. |
| **[Understand canvas app execution phases, data call flow, and performance monitoring](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/execution-phases-data-flow)** | When a user opens a canvas app, the app goes through several phases of execution before showing the user interface. While the app loads, it connects to different data sources. Learn about these different phases of execution and how an app connects to data sources and about tools you can use to monitor performance. |  
| **[Use Microsoft SQL Server securely with Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/connections/sql-server-security)** | There are different ways to connect and authenticate to SQL Server with Power Apps. This article outlines concepts that can be helpful in making a choice about how to connect to SQL Server with a security approach that matches requirements of your app. |
| **[Connect to SQL Server from Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/connections/connection-azure-sqldatabase)** | There are different ways to connect to data in SQL Server in your app, using Power Fx formulas. You can access data directly or use a view or stored procedures to create, update, or delete data in your app. |

## Reference architectures

| Title | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[Streamline document processing with AI Builder](../reference-architectures/ai-document-processing.md)** | Streamline document processing and automate data extraction from various documents such as forms, invoices, and purchase orders. |
| **[Perform predictive data analysis with Dataverse, Fabric, and Azure AI](../reference-architectures/ai-predictive-data-analysis.md)** | Learn best practices for data ingestion, model training, and visualization, enabling you to build robust predictive models and actionable insights. |
| **[​Integrate Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse data using Microsoft Dataverse virtual tables](../reference-architectures/app-integrate-lakehouse.md)** | Gather data from multiple internal systems into a Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse, and consume the data in Power Platform apps and automations using Dataverse virtual tables. |
| **[Integrate Power Platform with SAP](../reference-architectures/arch-pattern-sap.md)** | Learn about the architecture, workflows, and connectivity methods available to integrate Power Platform with SAP to ensure a smooth integration process. |
| **[Leverage Dataverse background operations](../reference-architectures/dataverse-background-operations.md)** | Use custom APIs to define custom messages and implement business logic through plug-ins, allowing for background processing that eliminates the need for a persistent connection during execution. |
| **[Secure Power Platform access to Azure resources](../reference-architectures/secure-access-azure-resources.md)** | Use Microsoft Azure Virtual Network support for Power Platform to integrate Power Platform with resources inside your virtual network without exposing them to the public internet. |
| **[Use REST APIs to extend the functionality of canvas apps](../reference-architectures/custom-connector-canvas.md)** | When working with complex algorithms or multiple data sources, shift the logic from the canvas app to a RESTful API to keep formulas in your Power Apps canvas application simple and move more complex functionality to the server. |
| **[​Use the Dataverse connector with canvas apps​](../reference-architectures/dataverse-canvas-app.md)** | Learn how creating a Power Apps application that uses Dataverse as a data source helps build a more custom user experience. |
