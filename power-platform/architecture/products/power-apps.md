# Power Apps reference architectures and solution ideas

Microsoft Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, and connectors that provides a rapid development environment for building low-code custom apps. Using Power Apps, you can quickly build business apps that connect to your organization's data, whether it's stored in [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro)&mdash;the underlying data platform for all Power Platform products&mdash;or in other online and on-premises data sources.

Understanding Power Apps reference architectures and exploring solution ideas can help you unlock new opportunities for automation, optimization, and innovation in your organization. In this article, we look at:

- **Key concepts**: Learn about key architecture concepts that help you build robust, efficient, and maintainable solutions with Power Apps.

- **Reference architectures**: Explore foundational reference architectures that support building well-architected solutions with Power Apps.

- **Solution ideas**: Discover a range of solution ideas that demonstrate the versatility and power of Power Apps.
