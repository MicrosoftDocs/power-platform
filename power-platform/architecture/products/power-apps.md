# Power Apps reference architectures and solution ideas

Power Apps is a suite of apps, services, and connectors, as well as a data platform, that provides a rapid development environment to build custom apps for your business needs. Using Power Apps, you can quickly build custom business apps that connect to your data stored either in the underlying data platform ([Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro)) or in many online and on-premises data sources (such as SharePoint, Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, SQL Server, and so on).
By understanding reference architectures and exploring solution ideas, you can unlock new opportunities for automation, optimization, and innovation within your organization.

In this article, we will look at:

- **Key concepts:** Learn about architecture key concepts that will help you build robust, efficient, and maintenable solutions with Power Apps.
- **Reference architectures**: Explore foundational reference architectures that support building well-architected solutions with Power Apps.
- **Solution Ideas**: Discover a range of solution ideas that demonstrate the versatility and power of Power Apps.
