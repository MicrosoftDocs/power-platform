# Use REST APIs to extend the functionality of canvas apps

> [!TIP]
> The article provides an example scenario and visual representation of how to use REST APIs to extend the functionality of canvas apps. This solution is a generalized example scenario architecture, which can be used for many different scenarios and industries.

Microsoft Power Platform enables you to extend the functionality of your Power Apps canvas application by using REST APIs. When dealing with complex algorithms or with many data sources, shifting the logic from the canvas app to a RESTful API can be a good choice to help keep your formulas within your Power Apps canvas application simple while moving more complex functionality server-side. Power Platform custom connectors allow canvas apps to use the REST API just like another data source.

## Workflow

1. **Canvas app**: The Power Apps canvas app uses the custom connector to access operations exposed by the Azure Function. The user authenticates to the application using Microsoft Entra ID, and access to the data is limited to data the user can access.
1. **Custom connector**: The custom connector describes which operations the application can use from the REST API, which in the example is implemented by an Azure Function. By using a custom connector, the Power Apps canvas application can use the logic like any other data source.
1. **Microsoft Entra ID apps**: The Azure Function is secured using a Microsoft Entra ID app. A second Microsoft Entra ID app is registered and configured on the custom connector to allow the Power Apps canvas app to access the Azure Function operations.
1. **Azure Function**: The Azure Function implements the RESTful API, offering one, or more operations that are exposed to the Power Apps canvas application by either exporting a custom connector from the Azure portal or by manual configuration. The Azure Function is secured by a Microsoft Entra ID app registration to ensure only authorized callers.
1. **Azure Cosmos DB**: The Azure Function can use Azure Cosmos DB, Azure SQL, or any other cloud data store it requires to manage the data. In fact, the function could be working with data in Microsoft Dataverse using the function approach due to the complexity of the logic.

## Components

- **[Power Platform environment](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview)**: Contains the Power Platform resources such as the Power Apps that implement the In Store app user experience. These resources are moved from one environment to another (for example, Dev to Test) using Dataverse solutions.

- **[Power Apps](/power-apps/)**: Power Apps is used to implement the user experience of the solution. Makers can build the application using the custom connector created by the developer of the Azure Function as an application data source.

- **[Custom connector](/connectors/custom-connectors/)**: Power Platform custom connectors describe the operations and data structures of a RESTful API. They allow the API to be easily used from resources like a Power Apps canvas application. When used from Power Apps, they allow the API to be referenced like any other data source.

## Use cases

Power Apps lets organizations create a custom user experience. By using REST APIs, the business logic is centralized and accessed by the application through a custom connector. This approach also lets the Power Apps application act as an integrator of multiple backend services, providing a single view of data and logic from all sources. Using the REST API approach shifts the complexity of interacting with multiple systems to a component implementing the REST API, simplifying the implementation of the canvas application while still providing the same user experience.

In the example above, the In Store app is created using a Power Apps canvas application. The application lets a store associate quickly save a backorder notification request for a customer when an item is out of stock. The application uses a single operation, `RecordBackorder`, configured on a custom connector that describes a backend Azure Function operation. In this example, the Azure Function implements the REST API. You can use any technology that supports creating a RESTful service to implement this pattern.

This architecture offers flexibility but requires more code-first developer work to develop and maintain the RESTful service and data layer. As the complexity of canvas app formulas increases, consider this type of architecture. For example, when multiple data sources are needed to build a single view, using an API layer helps deliver a performant experience because the data response is shaped server-side and delivered to the client more efficiently. This middle-tier layer also lets you add a server-side caching layer and implement richer telemetry for the app.

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of Power Platform Well-Architected, a set of guiding tenets that improve the quality of a workload. Learn more in [Microsoft Power Platform Well-Architected](/power-platform/well-architected/).

### Reliability

- **Design your workload to avoid unnecessary complexity**: Using the REST API approach from a Power Apps application via a custom connector avoids unnecessary complexity and also centralizes the logic where it could be used by other applications in the organization. The custom connector enables the Power Apps maker to use the operations from the RESTful API like any other data source operation.

- **Test for resiliency and availability**: By shifting the logic from the canvas app to the REST API, you should be able to independently test the API separate from the app that uses it.

- **Measure and publish the health indicators**: Telemetry should be captured from the REST API component to track its health. For example, using Azure Monitor â€“ Application Insights logging would ensure adequate tracking of the component.

### Security

Ensure the application uses separate Power Platform environments to support your application lifecycle stages, and ensure only the right users have access to each stage to support your segmentation policies.

### Operational excellence

- **Adopt safe deployment practices**: Standardize deployment of any changes to the Power Apps application by using automated deployment processes, such as pipelines. Promote the application to production only after testing changes.

- **Implement a deployment failure mitigation strategy**: With the dependency between the application and the REST API, you should ensure you have a tested strategy to mitigate a rollout of either that develops errors after one of the components is updated.

### Performance efficiency

- **Design to meet performance requirements**: Evaluate your solution performance and volume of data requirements. Evaluation should include how data is accessed and evaluation of how Power Apps using different data sources directly might be too chatty with the data sources. This can create a performance slowdown due to the latency of the individual request being sent to each data store. For example, if your application had logic that worked across a large number of rows in the data source, you might be able to shift all that network traffic to the backend Azure Function, reducing to a single interaction with the REST API, which in turn would manage interacting with the multiple other data sources where it could be done more effectively.

- **Optimize logic**: As logic becomes more complex in a canvas app, Azure Functions or similar backend RESTful API implementations can offload that logic to a centralized reusable service. Using the custom connector capability to describe those RESTful APIs allows canvas apps to use their configured operations like any other data source.

- **Test performance**: Along with testing for functionality and failures, it's important to test and develop a baseline for performance and evaluate it as part of your release cycle if the API is sensitive to changes in work completion times.

### Experience optimization

- **Design for efficiency**: Applications that allow users to access multiple data sources from a single Power Apps application without requiring them to interact with multiple individual applications make the user more efficient and are a good use of a more custom visual experience.
