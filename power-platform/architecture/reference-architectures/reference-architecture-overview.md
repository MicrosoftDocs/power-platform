# Reference architectures overview

Reference architectures are essential frameworks that guide the design and implementation of solutions using Power Platform and Copilot Studio.

By evaluating reference architectures, organizations can build powerful, reliable, and scalable solutions that meet their business needs and drive innovation.

| Title | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **[Distributed tracing across multiple services](distributed-tracing.md)** | Learn how to achieve comprehensive observability across multiple services, including those within Power Platform, Azure, and Dynamics 365. |
| **[Document processing with AI Builder](ai-document-processing.md)** | Streamline document processing and automate data extraction from various documents such as forms, invoices, and purchase orders |
| **[Predictive data analysis with Dataverse, Fabric, and Azure AI](ai-predictive-data-analysis.md)** | Perform predictive data analysis using Dataverse, Microsoft Fabric, and Azure AI and learn best practices for data ingestion, model training, and visualization, enabling you to build robust predictive models and actionable insights. |
| **[​Integrate Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse data using Microsoft Dataverse virtual tables](app-integrate-lakehouse.md)** | Gather data from multiple internal systems into a Microsoft Fabric Lakehouse, and consume the data in Power Platform apps and automations using Dataverse virtual tables. |
| **[Integrating Microsoft Power Platform with SAP](arch-pattern-sap.md)** | Learn about the architecture, workflows, and connectivity methods available to integrate Power Platform with SAP to ensure a smooth integration process. |
| **[Legacy data integration](../reference-architectures/app-legacy-data-integration.md)** | Streamline the process of integrating legacy data with modern platforms. |
| **[Dataverse background operations](dataverse-background-operations.md)** | Us custom APIs to define custom messages and implement business logic through plug-ins, allowing for background processing that eliminates the need for a persistent connection during execution. |
| **[Secure Power Platform access to Azure resources](secure-access-azure-resources.md)** | Use Microsoft Azure Virtual Network support for Power Platform to integrate Power Platform with resources inside your virtual network without exposing them to the public internet. |
| **[Use REST APIs to extend the functionality of canvas apps](custom-connector-canvas.md)** | When dealing with complex algorithms or with many data sources shifting the logic from the canvas app to a RESTful API can be a good choice to help keep your formulas within your  Power Apps canvas application simple while moving more complex functionality server-side. |
| **[​Use the Dataverse connector with canvas apps​](dataverse-canvas-app.md)** | Creating a Power Apps application that uses Dataverse as a data source can enable building a more custom user experience. |
