# What are templates and prebuilt agents for Microsoft Power Platform and SAP?

Templates and agents for Power Platform and SAP integration and solution development are created and published by Microsoft. They can be accessed at [Templates for Power Platform](https://github.com/microsoft/Templates-for-Power-Platform) on GitHub.

## Templates for Power Platform and SAP

 Templates for Power Platform and SAP are frameworks designed to help you configure, deploy, and manage SAP solutions on Power Platform. You can deploy them as-is or customize and extend them to suit your business needs. You can also use the templates as guides to help you see how to build complex, enterprise-grade solutions.

During the design phase, a solution template helps a maker see how:

- System data can be accessed and organized in a streamlined view in Power Apps.
- Workflows can be automated by Power Automate cloud flows operating behind the scenes.
- Solutions can be enhanced and extended to meet an organization's needs.

## Agents for Power Platform and SAP

Agents for Power Platform and SAP are advanced, LLM-based assistants that translate business-oriented goals into actionable SAP NetWeaver tasks. The agents are powerful tools that provide dynamic, installation-specific insights to maximize accuracy when working to integrate Power Platform with a specific SAP system.

During the design phase, an agent helps a maker discover what specific SAP BAPIs, RFCs, and table reads are needed to achieve their business goals.

## Administration

Power Platform and SAP integration and solution development are enterprise-grade initiatives that should be carried out by a knowledgeable, [centralized team](/power-platform/guidance/adoption/delivery-models#centralized) that consists of key stakeholders, product owners, business analysts, Power Platform administrators and developers and SAP admins (S-User) and functional analysts (SAP BASIS).
