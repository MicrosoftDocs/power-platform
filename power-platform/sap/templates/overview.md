## Templates for Power Platform and SAP

 Templates for Power Platform and SAP are frameworks designed to help you configure, deploy, and manage SAP solutions on Power Platform. You can deploy them as-is or customize and extend them to suit your business needs. You can also use the templates as guides to help you see how to build complex, enterprise-grade solutions.

- Workflows can be automated by Power Automate cloud flows operating behind the scenes.
- Solutions can be enhanced and extended to meet an organization's needs.
