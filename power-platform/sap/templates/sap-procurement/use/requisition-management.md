# Get started using the SAP Requisition Management app

The SAP Requisition Management app is part of the SAP Procurement solution for Microsoft Power Platform. It allows you to do several functions in SAP quicker and easier than using SAP GUI. You can search, view, and update an existing requisition, create a new requisition, and convert a requisition to a purchase order.

## View requisition data

You have three options for viewing a requisition:

- Enter a known requisition number.
- Select a recent requisition that you have interacted with.
- Search for a requisition based on vendor and date range.

### Enter a requisition number

If you know the requisition number of the document you want to view, you can type it in the _Search Purchase Requisitions_ field and select **Search**.

### Select a recent requisition

You can select a recently viewed requisition from the *Recently Searched Requisitions* list. Select a requisition from the list to load onto your screen.

### Search for requisition

If you haven't interacted with the requisition, and you don't know the exact number, you can search for a requisition.

1. Select **Search Purchase Requisitions** to open the *Requisition search* screen. On the screen, you can search by any individual field or a combination of *Requisition Number*, *Vendor*, and *Date Range*.

## Create a requisition

You can create a new requisition:

## Add line items to a requisition

1. Select the appropriate *Location* from the dropdown list.

1. If you know your material number, enter it and select **Search** to find it, or you can find it by selecting **Go to advanced search**. Once a material is selected, the *Description* and *Unit* fields will be pre-populated. 

1. Enter the quantity and the unit price.

1. View the total automatically calculated based on the quantity multiplied by the unit price.

1. Select **Add Line Item** to add this line item to the requisition.

1. Repeat the steps above until all line items have been added.

## Submit the requisition

1. After all line items have been added, select **Next*.

1. On the *Review Purchase Requisition* page, review to make sure the information is correct, then select **Submit**.

## Additional functionalities

You can edit, sort, and filter requisition data.

### Edit a requisition

When you load an existing requisition, you have the ability to edit it. You can also convert it to a purchase order.

Select **Edit Requisition** to edit a requisition which enables you to change values, add more line items, or delete unwanted line items. You can also copy an existing line by selecting it and then selecting **Copy**.

### Sort requisition column headings

You can sort column headings by ascending or descending order. To sort, select **Column Heading**. An *arrow* appears to show you the sort order.  

> [!NOTE]
>
> The sort is done as a character string, so numbers may not be in numeric order.

## Field mappings

The table provides requisition screen to function module field mappings.
