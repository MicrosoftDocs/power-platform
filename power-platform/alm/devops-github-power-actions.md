# Preview: Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools tasks
[This topic is pre-release documentation and is subject to change.]

The GitHub actions for the Power Platform are described in the following sections. Afterwards, we will showcase some example GitHub workflows using some of these actions. For information about the GitHub actions for the Power Platform and how to download them, see [GitHub actions for the Power Plaform](devops-github-power.md).

## Configure deployment credentials
Many of the actions require you to connect a Power Platform environment. You add credentials as secrets in your the GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.

## Helper task

The available helper tasks are described below.

### Power Platform WhoAmI

Verifies a Power Platform environment service connection by connecting and making a WhoAmI request. This task can be useful to include early in the pipeline, to verify connectivity before processing begins.

| Parameters    | Description   |
|---------------|---------------|
| environment-url | The URL for the environment you are connecting to.|
| user-name | Username of the account you are using to connect with |
| password-secret | password for the user-name. Passwords are defined in **Settings** under **Secrets**. Note that you cannot retrieve a secret after it has been defined and saved |

## Quality check

Below are the available tasks for checking the quality of a solution.

### Power Platform Checker

This task runs a static analysis check on your solutions
against a set of best-practice rules to identify any problematic patterns that
you might have inadvertently introduced when building your solution.

| Parameters         | Description      |
|--------------------|------------------|
| environment-url                         | (Required) The URL for the environment you are connecting to. A connection to a licensed Power Platform environment is required to use the Power Platform checker.|
|tenant-id| Tenant ID of the Power Platform.|
|application-id | Azure Application ID to authenticate with. See  [Configure service principal connections for Power Platform environments](devops-build-tools.md#configure-service-connections-using-a-service-principal) for more information on how to configure service principals name (SPN) |
|client-secret | Client secret for the application ID. Client secret is defined in **Settings** under **Secrets**| 
| checker-endpoint       | By default, the gelocation of the checker service will use the same geo as the environment you connect to. By unchecking the default, you have an option to specify another geo to use, for example https://japan.api.advisor.powerapps.com. For a list of available geographies, see [Use the Power Platform Checker API](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/checker/webapi/overview#determine-a-geography).|
| location-type       | (Required) Specify whether to reference a local file or a reference file from a shared access signature (SAS) URL.<p/>Note: It is important to reference an exported solution file and not the unpacked source files in your repository. Both managed and unmanaged solution files can be analyzed. |
| file-location | (Required) Specify the path and file name of the zip files to analyze. Wildcards can be used. For example, enter \*\*\\*.zip for all zip files in all subfolders.<p/>If **File from SAS URI** was chosen as location of files to analyze, simply enter the SAS URI. You can add more than one SAS URI through a comma (,) or semi-colon (;) separated list.     |
| rule-set                          | (Required) Specify which rule set to apply. The following two rule sets are available:<ul><li> Solution checker: This is the same rule set that is run from the Power Apps [maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com).</li><li>AppSource: This is the extended rule set that is used to certify an application before it can be published to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).</li></ul>    |
| error-level | Combined with the Error threshold parameter defines the severity of errors and warnings that are allowed. |
| error-threshold | Defines the number of errors of specified level that are allowed for the checker to pass the solutions being checked. |

## Solution tasks

This set of tasks perform actions against solutions, and includes the following tasks.

## Build and release pipelines

Now that we've identified which actions you can take, let's see
how you can use these actions to create workflows that use multiple actions. Sample workflows are outlined below.

To learn more about creating these pipelines and actually do hands-on pipeline
authoring using GitHub actions for the Power Platform, complete the [GitHub actions for Power Platform labs](https://aka.ms/poweractionslab),
which you can download from GitHub.

For more information about on GitHub actions, see: [About GitHub Actions](https://help.github.com/actions/getting-started-with-github-actions/about-github-actions)
