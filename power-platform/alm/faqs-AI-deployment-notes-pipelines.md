These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of use Copilot to generate deployment notes with pipelines in Power Platform.

## What's use Copilot to generate deployment notes in pipelines?

AI-generated deployment notes is a feature in pipelines for Power Platform that allows you to seamlessly generate deployment notes to provide more context to your deployment record. The only steps are to review what AI has generated for you (pre-filled in the **Deployment notes** field), and continue to deploy.

## What are the system’s capabilities? 

This capability is powered by [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview), which uses powerful language models. These language models generate new text in English that looks and sounds like text written by humans.  

Using Azure OpenAI service as a foundation, deployment notes will be generated in the form of a solution overview, providing a concise solution description and an overview of its components. These notes are based on component metadata such as name, description, and type.

## What is the system’s intended use?

AI-generated deployment notes help admins approve and manage deployments in their organization, providing insight into what a solution contains and its purpose. AI-generated content may have mistakes. Make sure it's accurate and appropriate before using it.

## How was use Copilot to generate deployment notes in pipelines evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

Use Copilot to generate deployment notes in pipelines underwent substantial testing before the feature was released in preview. If you encounter issues with the content being generated, please submit feedback. Your feedback will be used to improve Microsoft products and services. IT admins for your organization can view and manage your feedback data.
