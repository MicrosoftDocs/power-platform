# Scenario 1: Citizen development

This scenario aims at the legacy canvas app makers and flow makers in Power Apps and Power Automate, respectively, who work in a Microsoft Dataverse environment *without* a Dataverse database.

You currently build canvas apps and flows that aren't* part of a solution, and
share your apps and flows by specifying each user by name or specifying a
security group in Microsoft Entra who can access your app or flow.

The end goal is to move your legacy canvas app and flows to a managed application lifecycle management (ALM) model by creating apps and flows in a Dataverse solution.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use the default Dataverse environment as a playground to get acquainted with the app-building experience. However, if you're shipping shared components (such as tables and Copilot agents) along with your apps and flows as part of a solution, we recommend you move to a model where you have multiple environments, each dedicated for the development, testing, and release of your apps. For more information about environments, go to [Types of environments used in ALM](basics-alm.md#types-of-environments-used-in-alm).

For legacy canvas app and flow makers to participate and move to a healthy ALM model, follow these steps:

1. Work with your IT admin/organization to discuss your business processes and
    environment strategy, such as the number of environments, access
    permissions, groups, and security. More information: [ALM environment strategy](environment-strategy-alm.md)

2. Understand the concept of solutions in Dataverse as a mechanism to transport and share components with others. You can export a solution from one environment to another to easily and securely share your apps and flows.
More information: [Solution concepts](solution-concepts-alm.md)

3. Follow the steps in [Scenario 0: ALM for a new project](new-project-alm.md) to move to a healthy ALM.
