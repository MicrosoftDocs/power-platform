# Scenario 0: ALM for a new project
If you're new to Power Apps and creating your first app, follow the
tasks described in this article to successfully deploy a functioning application to your production environment using a healthy application lifecycle management (ALM) strategy.

| Task  | Description       | More information   |
|-------|-------------------|--------------------|
| 1. Plan and implement your environment strategy.           | Determining the environments you'll need and establishing an appropriate governance model is a critical first step. At a minimum, you should have two environments: dev and production. However, we recommend that you have three environments: dev, test, and production. | [Environment strategy](environment-strategy-alm.md) |
| 2. Create a solution and publisher.      | Start with a blank solution, and create a custom publisher for that solution.        | [Solution publisher](solution-concepts-alm.md#solution-publisher)    |
| 3. Set up your DevOps project.     | Set up a DevOps project in which you'll later add several pipelines to perform required processing like export and deployment of your solution.         | [Setting up continuous integration and deployment](basics-alm.md#continuous-integration-and-deployment)<br /><br /> [Create a project](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/pipelines-sign-up?view=azure-devops#create-a-project)   |
| 4. Create your export from development pipeline in DevOps. | Create a DevOps pipeline to export your completed unmanaged solution to a managed solution.     | [Create your first pipeline](/azure/devops/pipelines/create-first-pipeline?view=azure-devops)<br /><br />[Build and release pipelines](devops-build-tool-tasks.md#build-and-release-pipelines)<br /><br /> [Build pipeline: Export a solution from development (DEV)](devops-build-tool-tasks.md#build-pipeline-export-solution-from-development)            |
| 5. Configure and build your app.     | Create your app within the solution you created.   | Model-driven apps: [Build your first model-driven app from scratch](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/build-first-model-driven-app)<br /> <br />Canvas apps: [Create an app from scratch using Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/data-platform-create-app-scratch)     |
| 6. Add any additional customizations to that solution.     | Add additional components as needed. Choose from a vast selection of components, such as flows, AI models, export to data lake configuration, web resources, plug-ins, and even other apps.  | [Create components in a solution](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/use-solution-explorer#create-components-in-a-solution)<br /><br />[Add an existing component to a solution](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/use-solution-explorer#add-an-existing-component-to-a-solution) |
| 7. Create a deployment pipeline in DevOps.                 | Create a DevOps pipeline to deploy your managed solution to one or more target production environments.      | [Build and release pipelines](devops-build-tool-tasks.md#build-and-release-pipelines)<br /><br /> [Release pipeline: Deploy to production (PROD)](devops-build-tool-tasks.md#release-pipeline-deploy-to-production)   |
| 8. Grant access to the app.     | Assign licensing and assign security roles to share applications with users.      | [Licensing](basics-alm.md#licensing)<br /><br /> [Share a model-driven app](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/share-model-driven-app)<br /><br /> [Share a canvas app](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/share-app)    |
