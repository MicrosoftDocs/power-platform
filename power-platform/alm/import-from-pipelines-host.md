# Import solutions from a pipelines host

When selecting **Import solution** from the command bar on the **Solutions** page in Power Apps (make.powerapps.com), you can choose **Pipelines** as a source if the current environment is associated with a pipelines host.

## Select a solution from the list

The list of solutions is generated by reading the deployment artifacts that you own as the deployer, separating managed solutions and unmanaged solutions as both are stored in the host. Users can toggle between **Unmanaged** and **Managed** to choose the appropriate solution type they would like to import.

## Show shared solution deployments

By default, all users aside from admins (who can always view all deployments in their tenant) are able to see their deployed solutions only. However, if enabled in **Advanced Settings** in the pipelines host's Deployment Pipeline Configuration app, all users can switch the **Show shared solution deployments** toggle to view all shared deployments, which, by default, includes all deployments in the tenant.
