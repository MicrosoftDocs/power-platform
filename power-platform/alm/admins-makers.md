# ALM for admins and makers

This section describes how you as a Power Platform administrator or app maker can use available features, tools, and other resources to implement application lifecycle management (ALM) using Microsoft Power Platform.

## Git integration

Source control integration allows development teams to sync solutions and solution objects across one or more Microsoft Dataverse environments using an Azure DevOps Git repository. The source control integration functionality is available natively within the solutions experiences, ensuring citizen developers, code-first developers, and administrators can benefit from version control, change tracking, and seamless team collaboration across different tools and environments.

More information: [Overview of Dataverse Git integration (preview)](git-integration/overview.md)

## Pipelines

With pipelines in Power Platform, admins create and configure pipelines so makers can use them to deploy solutions to environments with a single click.

More information: [Overview of pipelines in Power Platform](pipelines.md)

## Manage solutions using PowerShell

PowerShell cmdlets let admins automate many of the monitoring, management, and quality assurance tasks in Power Platform.
