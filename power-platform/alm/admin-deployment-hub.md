# Admin Deployment page

[!INCLUDE [production-ready-preview-powerplatform](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/production-ready-preview-powerplatform.md)]

The Deployment page in the admin center provides a streamlined experience to help administrators navigate the complexities of managing Power Platform application lifecycle management (ALM) workloads, including managing pipelines deployments at enterprise scale. Admins have visibility of all the deployments in their tenant and can approve deployment requests and troubleshoot failures. 

## Use the Deployment page

1.	Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
1.	Enable **New admin center** in the upper right corner.
1.	In the navigation pane, select **Deployment**.

## Key capabilities
  > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > Currently the Deployment page does not have all the capabilities available within the [Deployment Pipelines Configuration app](custom-host-pipelines.md). 
   >

### Learn about the ALM process in Power Platform 
The Get started section provides helpful learning content and guidance to set up deployments using best practices.

### Manage deployments from one central location.

Pipelines in Power Platform allow you to manage the end-to-end deployment process across your organization. The deployment page makes it easy to view all the pipelines and deployment activity within the tenant. 

Admins can see all [pipelines host](custom-host-pipelines.md) environments in the tenant, including the platform host, and **select a host** to see all the pipelines and deployment history managed by that host. 
A dedicated **Failed deployments** view helps admins quickly identify and troubleshoot failures. Select Pipelines in the left navigation, then **Run history** to see all deployments. 

### Review and approve deployment requests

On the Deployment page, admins can approve or reject deployment requests assigned to them. You’ll first need to [setup Delegated deployments](delegated-deployments-setup.md) with service principals, which is recommended as the secure way to securely deploy to production environments. 
It’s important admins review changes in the solution and the sharing request. Once approved, the solution is deployed, and solution objects and security roles will be shared automatically. Notice other types of approvals within the pipelines host environment can also be managed here.
