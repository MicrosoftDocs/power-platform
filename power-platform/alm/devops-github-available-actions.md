# Available GitHub Actions for Microsoft Power Platform development

[GitHub Actions for Microsoft Power Platform](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/powerplatform-actions) are described in the following sections. In addition, sample GitHub workflows shown as well. For more information about GitHub Actions and how to download them, go to [GitHub Actions for Microsoft Power Platform](devops-github-actions.md).

## Configure credentials to use with GitHub Actions with Microsoft Power Platform

Many of the actions require you to connect to a Microsoft Dataverse environment. You can add service principal or user credentials as secrets in your GitHub repository and then use them in your workflows.

- For details on how to set up secrets in GitHub, see [Encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow) 

- For details how to set up service principal authentication for Microsoft Power Platform, see [DevOps Build tools](devops-build-tools.md#configure-service-connections-using-a-service-principal)

Once configured, you can call the Service Principal from with in your Action scripts. 

Parameters to define within your GitHub Action Script as [Environment Variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environment-variables):

- Application ID such as: `WF_APPLICATION_ID:<your application id>`
- Tenant ID such as: `WF_TENANT_ID:<your tenant id>`

The client Secret must be added and stored as a GitHub Secret, and will be referenced from within the workflow using a parameter like: 
`client secret: ${{secrets.CLIENT_SECRET_GITHUB_ACTIONS}}`

## Helper tasks

The available helper task is described below.

### whoAmI

Verifies the service connection by connecting to the service and sending a `WhoAmI` [[SDK](/dotnet/api/microsoft.crm.sdk.messages.whoamirequest)/[Web API](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/whoami)] request. This task can be useful to include early in your GitHub workflow, to verify connectivity before processing begins.
