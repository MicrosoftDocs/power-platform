# Available GitHub Actions for Microsoft Power Platform administration 

This article provides information about GitHub Actions that are available to administer Microsoft Power Platform.

## Configure credentials to use within your GitHub workflows

Many of the actions require you to connect to a Microsoft Dataverse environment. You can add service principal or user credentials as secrets in your GitHub repository and then use them in the workflow.

- For details about how to set up secrets in GitHub, go to [Using encrypted secrets in a workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow).

- For details about how to set up service principal authentication for Microsoft Power Platform, go to [Configure service connections using a service principal](devops-build-tools.md#configure-service-connections-using-a-service-principal). After it's configured properly, you can call the service principal from within your action scripts.

Define the following parameters within your GitHub Actions script as [environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/environment-variables):

- Application ID: `WF_APPLICATION_ID:<your application id>`
- Tenant ID: `WF_TENANT_ID:<your tenant id>`

The client secret will be stored as a GitHub secret, as described in [Encrypted secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets), and will be referenced from within the action script by using a parameter like
`client secret: ${{secrets.CLIENT_SECRET_GITHUB_ACTIONS}}`.

## Administrative tasks

The available administrative tasks are explained below.
