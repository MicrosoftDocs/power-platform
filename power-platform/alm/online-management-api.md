# Online Management API (REST) to manage environments

The Online Management API is a REST API that lets you create and manage Common Data Service environments in your Microsoft 365 organization. As application publishers or ISVs, you can use the Online Management API to:

* Automate the creation of custom demo Common Data Service environments.
* Manage multiple Common Data Service environments, in case your enterprise includes multiple organizations.

Using the Online Management API, you can perform various tasks on your environment such as create, retrieve, delete, backup and restore environments, and other environment-related tasks. More information:
