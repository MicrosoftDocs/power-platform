# Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools tasks

The available build tasks are described in the following sections. Afterwards, we will showcase some example Azure DevOps pipelines making use of these tasks. For information about the build tools and how to download them, see [Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools for Azure DevOps](devops-build-tools.md).

## Helper task

The available helper tasks are described below.

### Power Platform Tool Installer

This task is required to be added once before any other Power Platform Build Tools tasks in build and
release pipelines. This task installs a set of Power Platform&ndash;specific tools required
by the agent to run the Microsoft Power Platform build tasks. This task doesn't require any
more configuration when added, but contains parameters for the specific versions
of each of the tools that are being installed.

To stay up to date with the tool versions over time, make sure these parameters correspond
to the versions of the tools that are required for the pipeline to run properly.

#### YAML snippet (Installer)

```yml
# Installs default Power Platform Build Tools
- task: microsoft-IsvExpTools.PowerPlatform-BuildTools.tool-installer.PowerPlatformToolInstaller@0
  displayName: 'Power Platform Tool Installer'
```

```yml
# Installs specific versions of the Power Platform Build Tools
- task: microsoft-IsvExpTools.PowerPlatform-BuildTools.tool-installer.PowerPlatformToolInstaller@0
  displayName: 'Power Platform Tool Installer'
  inputs:
    DefaultVersion: false
    XrmToolingPackageDeploymentVersion: 3.3.0.928
```

#### Parameters (Installer)

| Parameters    | Description   |
|---------------|---------------|
| `DefaultVersion`<br/>Use default tool versions | Set to **true** to use the default version of all tools, otherwise **false**. Required (and **false**) when any tool versions are specified. |
| `PowerAppsAdminVersion`<br/>`XrmToolingPackageDeploymentVersion`<br/>`MicrosoftPowerAppsCheckerVersion`<br/>`CrmSdkCoreToolsVersion`<br/>Tool version | The specific version of the tool to use. |

### Power Platform WhoAmI

## Quality check

Below are the available tasks for checking the quality of a solution.

### Power Platform Checker

This task runs a static analysis check on your solutions
against a set of best-practice rules to identify any problematic patterns that
you might have inadvertently introduced when building your solution.

#### YAML snippet (Checker)

```yml
# Static analysis check of your solution
- task: microsoft-IsvExpTools.PowerPlatform-BuildTools.checker.PowerPlatformChecker@0
  displayName: 'Power Platform Checker '

Service connections are defined in **Service Connections** under **Project Settings** using the **Power Platform** connection type. More information: see `BuildTools.EnvironmentUrl` under [Power Platform Create Environment](#power-platform-create-environment)<p/>Note:Â Service Principal is the only authentication method available for the checker task so if you are using username/password for all other tasks, you will have to create a separate connection to use with the checker task. For more information on how to configure service principals to be used with this task, see [Configure service principal connections for Power Platform environments](devops-build-tools.md#configure-service-connections-using-a-service-principal). |
| `UseDefaultPACheckerEndpoint`<br/>Use default Power Platform Checker endpoint | By default (**true**), the geographic location of the checker service will use the same geography as the environment you connect to. |
| `CustomPACheckerEndpoint`<br/>Custom PAC checker endpoint | Required when `UseDefaultPACheckerEndpoint` is **false**. You have an option to specify another geo to use, for example `https://japan.api.advisor.powerapps.com.` For a list of available geographies, see [Use the Power Platform Checker API](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/checker/webapi/overview#determine-a-geography). |
| `FileLocation`<br/>Location of file(s) to analyze       | Required when referencing a file from a shared access signature (SAS) URL `sasUriFile`.<p/>Note: It is important to reference an exported solution file and not the unpacked source files in your repository. Both managed and unmanaged solution files can be analyzed. |
| `FilesToAnalyzeSasUri`<br/>SAS files to analyze | Required when `FileLocation` is set to `sasUriFile`. Enter the SAS URI. You can add more than one SAS URI through a comma (,) or semi-colon (;) separated list. |

| `FilesToExclude`<br/>Local files to exclude | Specify the names of files to be excluded from the analysis. If more than one, provide through a comma (,) or semi-colon (;) separated list. This list can include a full file name or a name with leading or trailing wildcards, such as *jquery or form.js |
| `RulesToOverride`<br/>Rules to override | A JSON array containing rules and levels to override. Accepted values for OverrideLevel are: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational. Example: [{"Id":"meta-remove-dup-reg","OverrideLevel":"Medium"},{"Id":"il-avoid-specialized-update-ops","OverrideLevel":"Medium"}] |
| `RuleSet`<br/>Rule set | (Required) Specify which rule set to apply. The following two rule sets are available:<ul><li> Solution checker: This is the same rule set that is run from the Power Apps [maker portal](https://make.powerapps.com).</li><li>AppSource: This is the extended rule set that is used to certify an application before it can be published to [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/).</li></ul>    |
| `ErrorLevel`<br/>Error Level | Combined with the error threshold parameter defines the severity of errors and warnings that are allowed. Supported threshold values are \<level>IssueCount where level=Critical, High, Medium, Low, and Informational. |
| `ErrorThreshold`<br/>Error threshold | Defines the number of errors (>=0) of a specified level that are allowed for the checker to pass the solutions being checked. |
| `FailOnPowerAppsCheckerAnalysisError`<br/>Fail on error | When **true**, fail if the Power Apps Checker analysis is returned as Failed or FinishedWithErrors. |
| `ArtifactDestinationName`<br/>DevOps artifact name | Specify the Azure DevOps artifacts name for the checker .sarif file. |

## Solution tasks

This set of tasks can automate solution actions. The environment tasks outlined later in this section that create, copy, or restore an environment will overwrite the service connections with the newly created environments. This makes it possible to perform solution tasks against environments that are created on demand.

| `SolutionVersionNumber`<br/>Solution version number | (Required) Version number you want to set. |

While version number can be hardcoded in the pipeline, it is recommended to use an Azure DevOps pipeline variable like [BuildId](/azure/devops/pipelines/build/variables#build-variables). 
This provides options to define the exact shape of version number under the "Options" tab, for example: $(Year:yyyy)-$(Month:MM)-$(Day:dd)-$(rev:rr)-3

This definition can then be used in the Set Solution Version task by setting the Version Number property with: $(Build.BuildId) instead of hard coding 20200824.0.0.2.

Alternatively a powershell inline task script $(Get-Date -Format yyyy.MM.dd.HHmm) output set to empty variable named SolutionVersion as Write-Host ("##vso[task.setvariable variable=SolutionVersion;]$version"), Set Solution Version as $(SolutionVersion).

### Power Platform Deploy Package

Deploys a package to an environment. Deploying a [package](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/package-deployer/create-packages-package-deployer) as opposed to a single solution file provides an option to deploy multiple solutions, data, and code into an environment.

## Environment management tasks

Automate common Environment Lifecycle Management (ELM) tasks.

### Power Platform Create Environment

Creates a new environment. Creating a new environment also automatically creates `BuildTools.EnvironmentUrl`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When set, `BuildTools.EnvironmentUrl` will be used as the **default service connection** for subsequent tasks in the pipeline. Each task described in this article only uses the endpoint from the service connection when `BuildTools.EnvironmentUrl` is not set.<p/>
> A new environment can only be provisioned if your license or capacity
> allows for the creation of additional environments. For more information on how to view capacity see [Capacity page details](../admin/capacity-storage.md#capacity-page-details).

## Build and release pipelines

Now that we've identified what can be done using the build tools, let's see
how you might apply these tools to your build and release pipelines. A
conceptual overview is shown below. Let's view some details of the pipeline implementation using the build tool tasks in the sub-sections that follow.

To learn more about creating these pipelines and actually do hands-on pipeline
authoring using the Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools, complete the [build tools labs](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/build-tools),
which you can download from GitHub.
