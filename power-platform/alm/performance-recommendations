1. Use Single-Stage Upgrade (--stage-and-upgrade)
Prefer --stage-and-upgrade over two-stage holding solutions. Two-stage upgrades (--import-as-holding) are slower.

2. Don't use Import as a Managed solution
The --convert-to-managed option is considered risky and deprecated.

3. Avoid Overwrite unmanaged customizations
The Overwrite unmanaged customizations option (--force-overwrite) forces the import process to overwrite any active customizations in the target environment. 
This can slow down the import significantly and is generally not recommended.

4. Don't use Publish customizations for managed solutions
Publish customizations is only needed for unmanaged solutions and should not be used for managed solutions as it would slow down the deployment.

5. Activate Plugins Only When Needed
Use --activate-plugins selectively to avoid overhead during import.
