# FAQ for optional data sharing for Copilot AI features in Dynamics 365 and Power Platform

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) article describes information related to optional data sharing to improve Dynamics 365 Copilot and Power Platform Copilot AI features and how Microsoft responsibly uses your data.

## What is data sharing for Copilot AI features?

Microsoft is constantly working to improve the quality of the new AI-powered Copilot features for Dynamics 365 Copilot and Power Platform Copilot to generate outcomes with better accuracy. One of the important ways to improve Copilot features is to better understand users’ inputs to the Copilot features, related outputs, and telemetry. Enabling the **Data sharing for Dynamics 365 Copilot and Power Platform Copilot AI Features** setting in the Power Platform admin center allows Microsoft to capture and manually review customer data including, but not limited to, users’ natural language inputs, outputs, and related telemetry to build, improve, and/or validate Microsoft’s features, services, machine learning models, and related systems for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Copilot AI features. We don't use customer data to train Azure OpenAI Service foundation models.

## How does it work?

You may opt in to participate by using the Power Platform admin center. To opt in: 

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/). 

1. In the left pane, select **Settings** > **Tenant Settings**, and turn on **Data sharing for Dynamics 365 Copilot and Power Platform Copilot AI Features** > **Enable Data Sharing** toggle. 

1. Select **Save**.

> [!NOTE]
> When this optional data sharing setting is off, we don’t use customer data under this program. 

## What are the benefits of opting in?

Sharing your data can benefit you in two ways:

- Existing Copilot AI features will become more effective as the models learn from and adapt to aggregate patterns observed in data shared through the program.
- We may derive new models that power new AI features in Dynamics 365 and Power Platform.

## If I've opted in, how can I withdraw my consent?

By default, the data sharing option is disabled for you. After you opt in, you can opt out any time by going to the **Settings** > **Tenant Settings** page in the Power Platform admin center and turning off the **Data sharing for Dynamics 365 Copilot and Power Platform Copilot AI Features** toggle. More information: [Tenant settings](admin/tenant-settings.md)

## What happens when I withdraw my consent?

You own your data. Microsoft uses your data only to provide the services we've agreed upon and for the purposes that are compatible with providing those services. Your data remains yours and we don't share it. If you leave this program, all your data is deleted within 30 days of opting out. However, we may still use your data up to end of the 30-day period.

## Who has access to my data?

Access to customer data is strictly controlled. Your data can be viewed only by the Microsoft employees who must view your data and have authorized access.  

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of the system?

Your data can only be accessed by Microsoft personnel with elevated access permissions. Your data is stored in your geographic data boundaries with a 30-day retention policy.

## What about data privacy?

All data is handled as per the Copilot data security and privacy guidelines explained in [FAQ for Copilot data security and privacy in Microsoft Power Platform](faqs-copilot-data-security-privacy.md).

## What about Customer Lockbox?

[Customer Lockbox](admin/about-lockbox.md) won't apply to the access and manual review of customer data shared using this setting.
