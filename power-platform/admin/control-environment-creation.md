# Control who can create and manage environments in the Power Platform admin center 

With the new provisioning model, those with the correct licenses can create an environment as long as 1GB of capacity is available. To restrict environment creation and management to admins, do the following:

1. Sign in to the Power Platform admin center at [https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).
2. Select the **Gear** icon (![Gear icon](media/selection-rule-gear-button.png)) in the upper-right corner of the Power Platform site.
3. Select **Power Platform settings**. 
4. Select **Only specific admins**.

The following admin roles will be able to create new environments in the Power Platform admin center:

- Global admin
- Dynamics 365 admin
- Power Platform admin

> [!NOTE]
> Environments created prior to restriction can still be managed after restriction by those who created the environment. Restriction will prevent any new environments being created and managed.
