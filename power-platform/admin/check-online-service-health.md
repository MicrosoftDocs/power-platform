# How do I check my online service health?

If you're experiencing problems with a cloud service, you can check the service health to determine whether this is a known issue&mdash;with a resolution in progress&mdash;before you call support or spend time troubleshooting. 

## Service health in the Power Platform admin center

You can view service health notifications by signing into the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/home) with an admin account.

### View a snapshot of service health

From the **Home** page, you can add **Service health** and **Message center** cards for a quicker view of active issues, or unread messages. 

To view all service health issues affecting your tenant in the last 30 days, go to [View service health](view-service-health.md).

## Service health in the Microsoft 365 admin center

The dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center provides a comprehensive view of the service health of your online services. Learn more in [How to check Microsoft 365 service health](/microsoft-365/enterprise/view-service-health).

### View a snapshot of service health

To view the issues and health status of all services that are available with your current subscriptions, sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) with an admin account. Learn more in [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

Select **Health** \> **Service health** from the navigation menu. 

You can also view the history of incidents and advisories that were resolved in the past 7 to 30 days by selecting the **Issue history** tab.

> [!NOTE]
> If the Power Platform or Microsoft 365 admin portals are unavailable or experiencing issues, we provide status updates through the unauthenticated [Service Health Status](https://status.cloud.microsoft) page. 

### View and track service changes

To keep track of upcoming changes, including new and changed features, planned maintenance, or other important announcements, select **Health** \> **Message center** from the navigation menu in the Microsoft 365 admin center. 

Learn more about Message center in [Track new and changed features in the Microsoft 365 Message center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/message-center).
