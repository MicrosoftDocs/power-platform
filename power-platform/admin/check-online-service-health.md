# How do I check my online service health?

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

You can quickly get the real-time status of your Microsoft Power Platform, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Microsoft 365 services.

## View service health information in the Power Platform admin center

You can view service health information in the Power Platform admin center.

To view all service health issues from the past 30 days, sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/home), and select **Help + support** \> **Service health**.

Learn more in [View service health](view-service-health.md).

## View service health information in the Microsoft 365 admin center

The dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center provides a comprehensive view of the service health of your online services. For example, if users have trouble signing in to Dynamics 365 apps, you can use this dashboard to determine whether a service outage occurred.

### View a snapshot of service health

Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) by using one of the Microsoft 365 admin roles that include service health monitoring. Learn more in [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

The dashboard provides a quick snapshot of the service health of some of your Microsoft 365 services.

To view information about all your services, select **Service health** on the dashboard (or select **Health** \> **Service health** on the menu).
