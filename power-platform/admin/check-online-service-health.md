# How do I check my online service health?

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

If you're experiencing problems with a cloud service, you can check the service health to determine whether this is a known issue with a resolution in progress before you call support or spend time troubleshooting. 
## Service health in the Power Platform admin center

You can view service health notifications by sigining into the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/home) with an admin account.

### View a snapshot of service health

From the Home page dashboard, you can add Service health and Message center cards for a quicker view of active incidents. 

To view all service health issues affecting your tenant in the last 30 days, select **Support** \> **Service health**. 

Learn more in [View service health](view-service-health.md).

## Service health in the Microsoft 365 admin center

The dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center provides a comprehensive view of the service health of your online services. Learn more [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/view-service-health?view=o365-worldwide).

### View a snapshot of service health

To view the issues and health status of all services that are available with your current subscriptions, sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) with an admin account. Learn more in [About admin roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).

Navigate to **Health** \> **Service health** on the menu.

You can also view the history of incidents and advisories that were resolved in the past seven to 30 days by selecting the **Issue history** tab.

### View and track service changes

To view and track upcoming service changes, select **Health** \> **Message center** on your home dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center. The changes that you can view include new and changed features, planned maintenance, and other important announcements.
