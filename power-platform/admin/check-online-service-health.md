# How do I check my online service health?

You can quickly get a real-time status of your Dynamics 365, Power Platform, and Microsoft 365 services. The dashboard on the Microsoft 365 admin center provides a comprehensive view of the service health of your online services. If you're experiencing problems with a service, you can check the service health to determine whether this is a known issue with a resolution in progress before you call support or spend time troubleshooting.

On the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) home page dashboard, admins can add [Service health](admin-documentation#monitor-service-health) and [Message center](admin-documentation#message-center) cards for a quicker view of incidents and upcoming changes.

## Microsoft 365 service health
You can see a snapshot of service health of your Microsoft services. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) and sign in using one of the Microsoft 365 admin roles that include service health monitoring. See [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles).  

Select **Health** > **Service health** to get more information on all your services.  

Select the **Issue history** tab to view the history of incidents and advisories that have been resolved in the past 7-30 days. 

## Power Platform admin center
In the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/home), you can go to **Help + support** > **Service health** to view all service health issues from the last 30 days. 
  
## Service changes

Select the **Health** > **Message center** on your home dashboard to view and track upcoming changes, including new and changed features, planned maintenance, or other important announcements
