# How do I check my online service health?

You can quickly get a real-time status of your Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365 services. The dashboard on the Microsoft 365 Admin Center provides a comprehensive view of the service health of your online services. If users are having trouble signing in to Dynamics 365 apps, check this page to see if there is a service outage.
