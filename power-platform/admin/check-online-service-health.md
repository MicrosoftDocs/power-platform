# How do I check my online service health?

You can quickly get a real-time status of your Dynamics 365 and Microsoft 365 services. The dashboard on the Microsoft 365 admin center provides a comprehensive view of the service health of your online services. If users are having trouble signing in to Dynamics 365 apps, check this page to see if there is a service outage.
  
## View a snapshot of service health  
Browse to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) and sign in using one of the Microsoft 365 admin roles that include service health monitoring. See [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles). You can see a quick snapshot of service health for some of your Microsoft 365 services.  Select **Service health** (from the menu: **Health** > **Service health**) to get more information on all your services.
