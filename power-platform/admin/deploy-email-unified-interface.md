# Enable accessible email flow

<!-- legacy procedure -->

To improve accessibility when reading and editing email in customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), we're introducing an app that provides an accessible email flow. This topic explains how admins can enable this flow and how end users can access it.

## For admins: Install the app

Follow these steps to deploy the solution and enable users to use the accessible flow.

**Install the app**

1. [!INCLUDE[proc_office365_signin](../includes/proc-office365-signin.md)] You can also sign in with system administrator or delegated admin security roles.  
  
2. Select **Admin centers** > **Dynamics 365**.  

3. Select the **environments** tab, select the environment to add the app to, and then select **Manage your solutions** ![Manage your solutions.](media/manage-solution.png "Manage your solutions").

4. Select the **Email in Unified Interface** app, and then select **Install**.  

You can now see the app in the list of published apps. Go to **Settings** > **My Apps** to see it.

**Provide users with permissions for the accessible email access flow**

For users who want to have accessible email access, follow these steps.

1.  Go to **Settings** > **Security** > **Users**.  
  
2.  In the list, select the user or users that you want to assign a security role to.  
  
3.  Select **Manage Roles**.  
  
    Only the security roles available for a user's business unit are displayed.  
  
4.  In the **Manage User Roles** dialog box, select the **Email app access role** security role, and then select **OK**.  

**Notify users**

Once the app is installed, notify users that they need to reload the web application to see and use the accessible email flow.

## For end users: Use the accessible email flow

Users with the **Email app access role**, go to **Sales**, **Service**, or **Marketing**. Select **Email Messages** to open emails.

> [!NOTE]
> - If you don't see **Sales**, **Service**, or **Marketing**, your customer engagement app has been customized. Talk to your administrator or customizer.
> - **Email Messages** will not appear if **Activities** has been customized to not be included in the sitemap.
