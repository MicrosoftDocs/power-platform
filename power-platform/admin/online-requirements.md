# Requirements/supported configurations  

Model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, give you the following options to access data:  
  
- Web browser. No need to install anything to run model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 from a computer running a supported web browser.  

- [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)]. An [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] add-in that provides you with a complete set of model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 capabilities right within [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Outlook_Full](../includes/pn-ms-outlook-full.md)].  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_Mobile_Express_long](../includes/pn-mobile-express-long.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_moca_short](../includes/pn-moca-short.md)]. Lightweight applications that let you access Common Data Service data on almost any web browser running on a tablet, smartphone, or non-Windows computer.  
  
## Web browser requirements  
 You use a common web browser, such as [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)], [!INCLUDE[tn_Mozilla_Firefox](../includes/tn-mozilla-firefox.md)], [!INCLUDE[tn_Google_Chrome](../includes/tn-google-chrome.md)] or [!INCLUDE[tn_Apple_Safari](../includes/tn-apple-safari.md)] to view, add, or edit information stored in your organization’s  database. For more information about the supported web browsers and hardware requirements, see [Web application requirements for Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps](web-application-requirements.md).  

## Mobile device requirements  
 Users can work in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 by using a supported browser on a mobile device, or by using [!INCLUDE[pn_Mobile_Express_long](../includes/pn-mobile-express-long.md)]. For more information about the mobile experience, see [Set up Dynamics 365 apps for phones and Dynamics 365 apps for tablets](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/mobile-app/set-up-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-dynamics-365-for-tablets).  

## Microsoft Office requirements  
 Model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 leverage the capabilities of on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../includes/pn-ms-office.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] and integrates with [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Word_Full](../includes/pn-ms-word-full.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Excel_Full](../includes/pn-ms-excel-full.md)]. For more information about the supported versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office](../includes/pn-ms-office.md)], see [Supported versions of Office](web-application-requirements.md#supported-versions-of-office).
