# Reset environment 

Reset a sandbox environment to delete and reprovision it. Consider a reset when you want to:  
  
- Create a new project  
- Free up storage space  
- Remove an environment containing personal data  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - You can only reset sandbox environments. 
> - A reset will permanently delete environment components such as canvas apps, flows, custom connectors, connections and back ups

 **An example scenario**  
  
 Thomas is looking at the storage consumed by the various Contoso environments. Thomas is getting concerned that they'll run out of space in one of their production environments. Thomas also wants to free up some space to give the production environment some extra storage. Thomas has also been notified that the Legal department has a retention policy regarding the use of production data in test environments.  
  
 After contacting Elisa, Thomas resets the Sales department's complete sandbox environment. The environment has been reprovisioned to factory settings. It's now ready for future use as a sandbox environment for a future project.  
 
### To reset an environment  

1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) and sign in using Environment Admin or System Administrator role credentials.
  
2. From the left-side menu, select **Environments**, and then select an environment to reset.
