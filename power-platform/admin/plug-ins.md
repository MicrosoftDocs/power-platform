# View information about plug-in steps
_Plug-ins_ contain code that enable server-side customization of Microsoft Dataverse data operations. Each plug-in is registered to execute at a specific point within that operation, which is called a step. You may need to find which plug-in steps are registered for specific events and you may need to temporarily disable plug-ins steps to avoid issues caused by the plug-in.

This article describes how you can view information about plug-ins and disable and enable them using the Power Platform Admin Center or Power Apps. You can also perform these actions by installing and using the [Plug-in Registration tool](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/download-tools-nuget) (PRT).
