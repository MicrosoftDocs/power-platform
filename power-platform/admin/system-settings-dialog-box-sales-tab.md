|              Maximum number of properties that are allowed for a product or bundle              | Type the maximum number of properties (specifications) a product or bundle can have. Product properties are added to a product family record, and all the child products and bundles under the product family inherit the properties added to the parent product family. The number specified in this setting is applied only when you publish a product or a bundle with the associated properties. |
