# Manage privacy and security settings

Use these settings to adjust customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), privacy and security.

These settings can be found in the Power Platform admin center by going to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Privacy + Security**.

Make sure you have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions to update the business closures.

**Check your security role**

- Follow the steps in [View your user profile](/powerapps/user/view-your-user-profile).
- Don’t have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.

## Replace the privacy statement for the organization  
 By default, the [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] privacy statement is always shown to users with an administrator role only, and not to other (business) users. As an administrator, you can add a link to specify your organization's privacy statement, which is then shown to other users in your organization.  
  
1. Go to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Privacy + Security**
  
2. Under **Privacy Preferences**, turn on **Show privacy statement link for this organization**.
  
3. In the **Privacy statement URL** box, type the link of the webpage you want to show.  
  
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Replace privacy statement for the organization.](media/privacy-preference-statement75.png "Replace privacy statement for the organization")
  
4. Select **Save**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Any user with the System Administrator security role will always see the [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] privacy statement and not the organization’s privacy statement.


## Set error reporting preferences for the organization 
 When errors occur in the product, data about the problem is sent to [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)]. This data – an error report - allows customer engagement apps to track and address errors relating to [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-microsoftcrm.md)]. You can help [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] improve products and services when you allow the system to send these error reports.  
  
 By default, individual users have a measure of control over whether to send error reports to [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)]. But you, as an administrator, can override their preferences and set up the error reporting preferences for the entire organization.  
  
1. Go to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Privacy + Security**
  
2. Under **Privacy Preferences**, **Default action to take when an error occurs**, select an action to take. 
  
   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select error notification preferences for users.](media/privacy-preference-error-notifications75.png "Select error notification preferences for users")
 
3. Select **Save**. 

When you use this setting, you can control error reporting for the entire organization by:  
  
-   Not allowing users to make changes in how error reporting occurs.  
  
-   Changing the default behavior for how error reporting happens.
