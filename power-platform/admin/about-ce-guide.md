# Administer model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 

Model-driven app administrators can use the Dynamics 365 admin center (<https://port.crm.dynamics.com/G/manage/index.aspx>) to manage the environment and settings. Model-driven apps admin content is available at [Administrator Guide for apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/admin-guide).

The content from the Customer Engagement admin guide is transitioning to the Power Platform admin guide as settings and features migrate to the Power Platform Admin center. Until the move to the Power Platform Admin center is complete, you’ll still be able to manage settings in Customer Engagement apps as usual.

For example, many of these admin settings in the Customer Engagement web client...

...are moving here.

Use links on this page to manage organization-wide settings. App-specific settings will remain in the model-driven apps, and will be accessed through the respective app settings. More information about managing environment settings in the Power Platform Admin center: [Manage environment settings](admin-settings.md)
