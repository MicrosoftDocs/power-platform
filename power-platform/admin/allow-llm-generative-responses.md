# Allow external large language models for generative responses

AI innovation moves ata a rapid pace, and each AI model has different strengths and specialies. With the **External models** rule and setting, you can allow the use of beta AI models for an environment or an environment group. These models offer an alternative approach to generative AI in Microsoft Copilot Studio. These models support advanced summarization and conversational capabilities and are now available in beta for evaluation purposes. The models available under this External models setting are Anthropic models that are hosted outside of Microsoft and subject to Anthropic terms and data handling.
