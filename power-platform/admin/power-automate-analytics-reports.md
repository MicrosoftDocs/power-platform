# Tenant-level analytics for Power Automate

Tenant-level analytics allow Power Platform admins to extract key service metrics based on user adoption across the environments they manage. Tailor made analytics are contained within reports embedded in the Power Platform admin center. 

The following tenant-level reports are available for Power Automate Cloud flows. 

## Power Automate - Usage reports

Power Automate reports provide insights into tenant and environment usage and inventory of all flows and connectors. The report answers questions such as:

- What is the total count of active Cloud flows across the tenant or environments?
- What is the count of Successful vs Failed runs across Cloud flows?
- How many flows exist in my tenant or environment?
- Which of my environments had the most unique users?
- What were the top flows across my tenant or environments by runs?
