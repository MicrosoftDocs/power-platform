# Microsoft Dataverse analytics

We've improved how you view metrics for your organization. You no longer need to install or update a solution. Instead, you can view Dataverse analytics right from the Microsoft Power Platform admin center to quickly view adoption and user metrics for your organization. 

To access these reports:

1. Go to the navigation bar on the left side.
2. Select **Analytics**.
3. Select **Dataverse**.
4. View the reports on the right side.

## Who can view these reports?

Admins with the following roles and a [license](pricing-billing-skus.md) can view the reports in Dataverse analytics: 
- Environment Admin - can view reports for the environments that the admin has access to.
- Power Platform admin – can view reports for all environments.
- Dynamics 365 admin - can view reports for all environments.
- Microsoft 365 Global admin – can view reports for all environments.

For more information on the different roles for managing your tenant across the platform, see [Use service admin roles to manage your tenant](use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant.md).

 **Key highlights**  

- **Deprecating the solution**: Organization Insights, available as a preferred solution from AppSource, will no longer be supported or available for use in future releases.  

- **Deprecating Organization Insights dashboard**: This dashboard will be removed from Dataverse in future releases. 

- **Monitor adoption and use**: Identify your most active users, the number and types of operations they're performing, number of pages requests, most-used entities, workflows, plug-ins, and more, over a period of time as you work toward your adoption goals.  

- **Manage storage and performance**: Monitor storage quotas, storage use, and top tables by size to optimize performance.  

- **Troubleshoot effectively**: Drill down into the details of your top failing workflows and API calls to quickly diagnose and troubleshoot errors.

## Download Reports

Select **Download** to view available downloads and then select any of the reports to download them into Microsoft Excel.

All the download reports, except "Active Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan Users by Application", show data:   
- for an environment <br />
  and <br />
- per the timeline in the filters for the out-of-box Dataverse analytics reports. If you select a certain date range for the out-of-box Dataverse reports, the same time filter applies to the downloads.  
- The maximum duration for data availability is 30 days.

The "Active Dynamics 365 Customer Engagement Plan Users by Application" report always shows the last 30 days of data at the tenant level.
