# Add Microsoft Dataverse storage capacity

You have options when you're running low on storage capacity. You can [free up storage](free-storage-space.md), [delete unwanted environments](delete-environment.md), or buy more storage capacity to be compliant with storage usage requirements. To learn more about storage capacity add-ons, see the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544) or the ["Add-ons" section of the Power Apps and Power Automate Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130). You can work through your organization's standard procurement process to purchase [capacity add-ons](capacity-add-on.md).

## Add storage space for your tenant

If you start to run out of storage, you can add storage to your subscription.  

> [!NOTE]
> The process described in this topic is to do a direct purchase using a credit card or invoice.
>
>If you bought your subscription through [Volume Licensing](/licensing/) or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), contact your representative or [partner](https://docs.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/commerce/manage-partners?view=o365-worldwide) for assistance. Customers with an Enterprise Agreement can [make a license reservation](/licensing/license-faq).

## Preliminary steps

1. You must be a Global or Billing admin to do the tasks in this article. For more information, see [About admin roles](https://docs.microsoft.com//microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide).
2. Determine your [current capacity storage usage](capacity-storage.md#verifying-your-new-storage-model) to make sure you know how much additional storage capacity is needed.

## Purchase add-on storage capacity
