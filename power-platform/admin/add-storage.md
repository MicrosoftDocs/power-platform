# Add more Microsoft Dataverse capacity for your tenant

You have options when you're running low on storage capacity. You can [free up storage](free-storage-space.md), [delete unwanted environments](delete-environment.md), or buy more storage capacity to be compliant with storage usage requirements. Learn more about storage capacity add-ons in [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=866544) or the ["Add-ons" section of the Power Apps and Power Automate Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130). You can work through your organization's standard procurement process to purchase [capacity add-ons](capacity-add-on.md).

If your tenant is running low on available storage capacity, you can add storage to your subscription.  

> [!NOTE]
> The process described in this topic applies to direct purchases using a credit card or invoice.
>
>If you bought your subscription through [Volume Licensing](/licensing/) or a Cloud Solution Provider (CSP), contact your representative or [partner](/microsoft-365/commerce/manage-partners?view=o365-worldwide) for assistance. Customers with an Enterprise Agreement can [make a license reservation](/licensing/license-faq).

## Prerequisites

- You must be a Microsoft 365 Billing admin to complete the tasks in this article. Learn more in [About admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide).
- You must determine your [current capacity storage usage](capacity-storage.md#verifying-your-microsoft-dataverse-capacity-based-storage-model) to make sure you know how much more storage capacity is needed. Non-admins can also [view self-service storage capacity](view-self-service-capacity.md).
