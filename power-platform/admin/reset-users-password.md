 For step-by-step instructions, see [Reset a User’s Password](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/reset-passwords).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The reset password is temporary. The user must change the temporary password at the next sign in. To help users meet the requirements for creating a new password in the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)], see [Set a user's password expiration policy](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/set-password-expiration-policy).
