You can use the **Licenses** page in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) to see how different user licenses are consumed in your finance and operations environments. With this information, you can get answers to questions like:

- What types of finance and operations licenses do you have available for your tenant?
- How many licenses have been assigned to users?
- How many roles have been assigned to users in different finance and operations environments, and what licenses are needed based on their role assignment?
- Are extra licenses needed based on role assignments in your tenant?


## Summary tab

To see a summary of license usage:

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

### User license level summary

The **User license level summary** section provides a summary count of user licenses available, assigned, and required for the tenant for finance and operations environments.

| Information | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| User license level | Type of finance and operations license available, or required by the tenant. |
| Available seats | Number of seats for a user license level available for the tenant. |
| Assigned seats | Number of users who are assigned licenses. |
| Required seats | Number of users who need licenses based on role assignment in finance and operations environments. |
| License utilization status | This status is calculated by comparing the number of roles assigned versus the number of licenses available |

You can view the individual licenses mapped to a license level, and the number of seats available for the individual license by selecting the number in the **Available seats** for a specific user license level.

### Drill-down view

Select the specific **User license level** to see a list, and more details of users who are required to have the selected license.
