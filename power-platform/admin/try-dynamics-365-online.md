# Try Dynamics 365 apps

[!INCLUDE [cc-settings-moving](../includes/cc-settings-moving.md)] 

We're excited about the release of [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-9-0-0-online](../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)] and hope you're eager to try it out. New and existing customers have different options to take a look at [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)].  

## Partners and Customizers
If you are a partner signing up on behalf of a customer, or are using this trial for development purposes, go to [https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/Signup/#](https://trials.dynamics.com/Dynamics365/Signup/#). You'll have the choice to add your trial to an existing tenant. You will also need to decide which apps to install when you start your trial. For more information on which scenario is right for you, see [Installation options](#installation-options) below. 

## New Dynamics 365 apps customers  
 If you're a new customer, we've made onboarding quick and easy. See the following for information on these applications available with [!INCLUDE[pn-crm-online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)].

## Current Dynamics 365 apps customers  
 If you already have a [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] subscription, there are a couple ways to see the latest version in action.  

### Start a trial  
 You can start a 30-day trial of [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] and try out one or all of the customer engagement applications. This trial uses the [!INCLUDE [pn-dyn-365](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] Customer Engagement Plan license.  

<!-- ![Trial experience for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement](../admin/media/trial-experience-dynamics-365.png "Trial experience for Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement")  -->

> [!NOTE]
>  You're allowed one trial per tenant. If you've already done a trial of [!INCLUDE[pn-crm_online_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-shortest.md)], you cannot do another trial. However, you can reset a Sandbox instance to the latest version or to one of the previous versions. See [Use a Sandbox instance](#use-a-sandbox-instance) below.
