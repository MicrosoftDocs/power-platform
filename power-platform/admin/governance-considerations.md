# Governance considerations 

Many customers wonder: How can Power Apps and Power Automate be made available to their broader business and supported by IT? Governance is the answer. It aims to enable business groups to focus on solving business problems efficiently while complying with IT and business compliance standards. The following content is intended to structure themes often associated with governing software and bring awareness to capabilities available for each theme as it relates to governing Power Apps and Power Automate. 

|Theme  |Common questions related to each theme for which this content answers  |
|---------|---------|
|Architecture     | <ul><li>What are the basic constructs and concepts of Power Apps, Power Automate, and Common Data Service?</li> <br /><li>How do these constructs fit together at design time and runtime?</li></ul> |
|Security     | <ul><li>What are the best practices for security design considerations?</li> <br /><li>How do I leverage our existing user and group management solutions to manage access and security roles in Power Apps?</li></ul>     |
|Alert and Action     | <ul><li>How do I define the governance model between citizen developers and managed IT services?</li> <br /><li>How do I define the governance model between central IT and the business unit admins?</li> <br /><li>How should I approach support for non-default environments in my organization? </li></ul>        |
|Monitor     | <ul><li>How are we capturing compliance / auditing data?</li> <br /><li>How can I measure adoption and usage within my organization?</li></ul> |

## Architecture
It's best to familiarize oneself with Environments as the first step to building the right governance story for your company. Environments are the containers for all resources utilized by a Power Apps, Power Automate and Common Data Service. [Environments Overview](environments-overview.md) is a good primer which should be followed by [Common Data Service](wp-cds-for-apps.md), [Types of Power Apps](wp-types-powerapps.md), [Microsoft Power Automate](wp-about-flows.md), [Connectors](wp-connectors.md),  and [On-premises Gateways](wp-onpremises-gateway.md). 

## Security 
This section outlines mechanisms that exist to control who can access Power Apps in an environment and access data: licenses, environments, environment roles, Azure Active Directory, Data Loss Prevention policies and admin connectors that can be used with Power Automate. 

### Licensing 
Access to Power Apps and Power Automate starts with having a license, the type of license a user has determines the assets and data a user can access. The following table outlines differences in resources available to a user based on their plan type, from a high-level. Granular licensing details can be found in the [Licensing overview](pricing-billing-skus.md).


|Plan  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Office 365 Included     | This allows users to extend SharePoint and other Office assets they already have. |
|Dynamics 365 Included     | This allows users to customize and extend model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, they already have.  |
|Power Apps plan  | This allows: <ul><li>making enterprise connectors and Common Data Service accessible for use.</li><li>users to use robust business logic across application types and administration capabilities.</li></ul>  |
|Power Apps Community | This allows a user to use Power Apps, Power Automate, Common Data Service and customer connectors in a single for individual use. There is no ability to share apps. |
|Power Automate Free | This allows users to create unlimited flows and perform 750 runs. |
|Power Automate plan| See [Microsoft Power Apps and Microsoft Power Automate Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2085130).|


### Environments
After users have licenses, environments exist as containers for all resources utilized by Power Apps, Power Automate and Common Data Service. Environments can be used to target different audiences and/or for different purposes such as developing, testing and production. More information can be found in the [Environments Overview](environments-overview.md).

### Secure your data and network
- Power Apps and Power Automate *do not* provide users with access to any data assets that they don't already have access to. Users should only have access to data that they really require access to.
- Network Access control policies can also apply to Power Apps and Power Automate. For environment, one can block access to a site from within a network by blocking the sign-on page to prevent connections to that site from being created in Power Apps and Power Automate. 
- In an environment, access is controlled at three levels: [Environment roles](database-security.md), Resource permissions for Power Apps, Power Automate, etcâ€¦ and [Common Data Service security roles](wp-security-cds.md) (if a Common Data Service data base is provisioned). 
- When Common Data Service is created in an environment the Common Data Service roles will take over for controlling security in the environment (and all environment admins and makers are migrated).

The following principals are supported for each role type.

|Environment type  |Role  |Principal Type (Azure AD)  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Environment without Common Data Service     | Environment role        | User, group, tenant         |
|     | Resource permission: Canvas app        | User, group, tenant        |
|     | Resource permission: Power Automate, Custom Connector, Gateways, Connections<sup>1</sup>        | User, group        |
|Environment with Common Data Service      | Environment role        | User        |
|     |Resource permission: Canvas app         |User, group, tenant         |
|     | Resource permission: Power Automate, Custom Connector, Gateways, Connections<sup>1</sup>          |User, group         |
|     |Common Data Service role (applies to all model-driven apps and components)         |User         |

<sup>1</sup>Only certain connections (like SQL) can be shared.

> [!NOTE]
> - In the Default environment, all users in a tenant are granted access to the Environment Maker role. 
> - Azure AD tenant Global Administrators have admin access to all environments.

#### FAQ - What permissions exist at an Azure AD tenant level? 

Today, Power Platform admins can perform the following: 

1. Download the Power Apps & Power Automate license report
1. Create DLP policy scoped only to 'All Environments' or scoped to include/exclude specific environments
1. Manage and assign licenses via Office admin center
1. Access all environment, app, and flow management capabilities for all environments in the tenant available through:
    - Power Apps Admin center
    - Power Apps Admin PowerShell cmdlets
    - Power Apps management connectors
1. Access the Power Apps and Power Automate admin analytics for all environments in the tenant:
    - <https://aka.ms/paadminanalytics>  
    - <https://aka.ms/flowadminanalytics> 

### Consider Microsoft Intune

Customers with Microsoft Intune can set mobile application protection policies for both Power Apps and Power Automate apps on Android and iOS. This walkthrough highlights setting a policy via Intune for Power Automate. 

### Consider location-based conditional access

For customers with Azure AD Premium, conditional access policies can be defined in Azure for Power Apps and Power Automate. This allows granting or blocking access based upon: user/group, device, location. 

#### Creating a Conditional Access Policy

1. Sign-in to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com) 
2. Select Azure Active Directory
3. Select Conditional Access.
4. Select + New Policy
5. Select user and groups
6. Select the cloud apps - select **Common Data Service** to control access to model-driven apps in Dynamics 365 (such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service)
7. Apply conditions (user/group, device, location) 

### Prevent data leakage with data loss prevent policies

[Data loss prevention policies (DLP)](wp-data-loss-prevention.md) enforce rules for which connectors can be used together by classifying connectors as either Business Data only or No Business Data allowed. Simply, if you put a connector in the business data only group, it can only be used with other connectors from that group in the same application. Power Platform admins can define policies that apply to all environments.

#### FAQ

Q: Can I control, on the tenant level, which connector is at all available, e.g. No to Dropbox or Twitter but Yes to SharePoint)?

A: This is not possible. Customers can subscribe to Audit events to perform corrective action if there are flows that have been built that create concerns for customers. In fact, a very large Power Apps customer has leveraged this approach to apply another level of governance.
 
Q: What about Sharing connectors between users? E.g. the connector for Teams is a general one that can be shared (?)

A: Connectors are available to all users. With the exception of premium or custom connectors which need either an additional license (premium connectors) or have to be explicitly shared (custom connectors)

## Alert and action

In addition to monitoring, many customers want to subscribe to software creation, usage or health events so they know when to perform an action. This section outlines a few means to observe events (manually and programmatically) and perform actions triggered by an event occurrence. 

### Leverage the [Power Apps and Microsoft Power Automate admin center](wp-work-with-admin-portals.md)

Environment and app management requires a Power Apps plan or a Power Automate plan. You can do the following:

1. View and manage environments.
2. View and manage all apps and flows within an environment.
     

### Build Power Automate flows to alert on key audit events

1.    An example of alerting that can be implemented is subscribing to Office 365 Security and Compliance Audit Logs. 
2.    This can be achieved through either a [webhook](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/blog/automate-flow-governance/) subscription or [polling](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/blog/accessing-office-365-security-compliance-center-logs-from-microsoft-flow/) approach. However, by attaching Power Automate to these alerts, we can provide administrators with more than just email alerts.

### Build the policies you need with Power Apps, Power Automate, and PowerShell

1. These [PowerShell cmdlets](powerapps-powershell.md) place full control in the hands of admins to automate the governance policies necessary. 
1. The [Management connectors](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/new-connectors-for-powerapps-and-flow-resources/) provide the same level of control but with added extensibility and ease-of-uses by leveraging Power Apps and Power Automate. 
1. The following Power Automate templates for administration connectors exist for ramping up quickly:
    1. [List new Power Automate Connectors](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/galleries/public/templates/5a6ef26db3b749ed88b7afb377d11ecf/list-new-microsoft-flow-connectors/)
    1. [Get List of new Power Apps, Power Automate flows and Connectors](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/galleries/public/templates/0b2ffb0174724ad6b4681728c0f53062/get-list-of-new-powerapps-flows-and-connectors/)
    1. [Email me a weekly summary of Office 365 Message Center notices](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/galleries/public/templates/c2537df7b47340e6bcf1ba931a459355/email-me-a-weekly-summary-of-office-365-message-center-notices/)
    1. [Access Office 365 Security and Compliance Logs from Power Automate](https://preview.flow.microsoft.com/blog/accessing-office-365-security-compliance-center-logs-from-microsoft-flow/)
1. Use this [blog and app template](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/custom-admin-dashboard-with-the-powerapps-admin-connectors/) ramp up quickly on the administration connectors. 
1. Additionally, it's worth checking out content shared in the [Community Apps Gallery](https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Community-Apps-Gallery/PowerApps-admin-app-version-2/m-p/247560), here's another example of an administrative experience built using Power Apps and admin connectors.

### FAQ

**Problem**
Currently, all users with Office E3 licenses can create apps in the Default environment. How can we enable Environment Maker rights to a select group, for example. 10 persons to create apps? 

**Recommendation**
The [PowerShell cmdlets](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/gdpr-admin-powershell-cmdlets/) and [Management connectors](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/new-connectors-for-powerapps-and-flow-resources/) provide full flexibility and control to administrators to build the policies they want for their organization.

<!-- 
Here are three samples: 

1. Download a report of activity with PowerShell. 
This scripts downloads 4 files, which capture all apps, app permission, flows, and flow permissions within a tenant.  

   > [!NOTE]
   > The calling user or user account must be a global admin and must have a Power Apps plan or a Power Apps trial.

2. Notify un-authorized app creators and share their app with administrators (automated with Power Automate). This is a daily flow that identified 'authorized' creators via a security group(s) check and sends a notification to un-authorized app creators and a summary report to administrators. The flow also shares the app with administrators for auditing.

3. Find and disable flows that leverage certain connectors
This is a flow that runs every 30 minutes and automatically disables flows that include certain connectors. In this flow I identified flows from the following connectors â€“ but the flow can be extended to identify any connector.
-->

## Monitor

It's well understood that monitoring as a critical aspect of managing software at scale, this section highlights a couple of means to get insight in Power Apps and Power Automate development and usage.  

### Review the audit trail

[Activity logging for Power Apps](logging-powerapps.md) is integrated with Office Security and Compliance center for comprehensive logging across Microsoft services like Common Data Service and Office 365. Office provides an API to query this data, which is currently used by many SIEM vendors to use the Activity Logging data for reporting.

### Download the Power Apps and Power Automate license report

1. [https://admin.powerapps.com/tenant/userLicenses](https://admin.powerapps.com/tenant/userLicenses) 
2. View Power Apps and Power Automate admin analytics
   1. Available now in preview from the new [Power Platform admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac). 
   2. One can get information along the following lines: 
      1. Active User and App usage  - how many users are using an app and how often? 
      2. Location â€“ where is the usage? 
      3. Service Performance of connectors
      4. Error reporting â€“ which are the most error prone apps
      5. Flows in use by type and date
      6. Flows created by type and date
      7. Application-level auditing 
      8. Service Health
      9. Connectors used

### View app resources used in an Environment

1. In the Power Apps Admin center, select Environments in the navigation menu. 
2. Select an Environment.
3. Optionally, the list of resources used in an Environment may be downloaded as a .csv.

<!--
## Deploy

The means by which software is developed, validated and deployed to a production environment is an important topic for each organization and happens to vary greatly from one organization to the next. As a reference, this section outlines how Microsoft's central IT organization manages and deploys Power Apps.

### How does Microsoft manage environments, maker roles, DLP policies? 

1.    Microsoft IT maintains at least 2 environments. 
2.    Admin and maker roles are assigned only to security groups, not individuals. 
3.    Environments are *not* geo-redundant. 
4.    The region for an environment is selected based on proximity to the users it will serve.
5.    Microsoft created an app services API that exposes app URLs by SG membership so we can support geo-redundancy (but don't do so currently).
6.    For development, there exists a sandbox environment where Makers can create apps here under their own user identity.
7.    For User Acceptance Testing, there exists an environment to test integration with other applications, deployment procedures, single-sign-on, etcâ€¦ Apps are authored by an official AAD security group account. 
8.    For production, there is a unique AAD security group for makers than for development and UAT. Apps are authored by the official AAD SG account. Deployment to this environment is locked down to avoid disruption and ensure the environment telemetry is accurate.
9.    Default DLP policies exist for the entire tenant that limit access to business data.

### How does Microsoft share apps and connectors? 

1.    Apps and connectors are shared to security groups only.
2.    Apps are directly authored in the studio for the development environment. Apps are then exported and imported into other environments. 
3.    Custom Connectors are shared to the entire org. 
4.    Since we restrict makers by access-control-lists, non-authorized users cannot enumerate environments in the powerapps studio nor can they re-use our connection objects to create unsponsored apps
5.    For development, connectors are shared as 'Can Edit' with the same SG used for the environment maker role and we allow the makers to create Custom Connectors.
6.    In UAT and Production, Custom Connectors are created under a service account and shared as 'can use' to the entire org and 'Can Edit' to our maker SG.
7.    Custom Connectors are patched for single-sign-on. 
8.    AAD app registrations are admin consented.
9.    The connection object is patched to use aadcertificate auth under the context of the Power Apps API Hub
10.    SQL connectors and push notification connectors show up in the Connections view as they are a shared environment. Makes must be educated to not delete these, as they are *not* a personal connection environment of a custom connector and deleting them will delete it for all users.

### How does Microsoft prepare for disaster recovery?

1.    For canvas apps, versioning is built-in the service and any maker can restore an app to a preview version. See [https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/restore-an-app](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/restore-an-app).
2.    For Microsoft Flows, we use the export feature to download the flow as a .zip package and archive the package.
3.    For all Common Data Service components, which use the same platform that powers Dynamics 365 apps, it benefits from the [built-in daily backup and restore capabilities](backup-restore-environments.md).
