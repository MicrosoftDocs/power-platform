# Use live chat with persistence for support requests

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

This feature improves the support experience by allowing customers to continue their conversation with Microsoft support engineers directly from the portal.

## What is live chat with persistence?

Live chat with persistence builds on Microsoft's existing live chat offering, enabling users to return to their previous chat sessions. If you created a [support request through Power Platform admin center](get-help-support.md#view-solutions-or-create-a-support-request-using-the-support-agent), you can revisit the chat at any time to add more information or check for updates.

### Key benefits

**Continued Conversations**: You don't need to wait for an engineer to join the conversation or start a new email thread when you need to add information to your support request. You can pick up where you left off with our new persistent chat feature.

**Efficient Issue Resolution**: By maintaining a single thread of conversation, you and our support engineers can keep track of all relevant details. Your conversations are a quicker and more efficient resolution of your support requests.

**Ease of Access**: To go back to your chat, select your issue from the portal and choose **Open Chat** to resume your conversation.
