# What fields can be synchronized with Outlook?

Administrators can set whether a sync occurs and the sync direction for customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)] fields.

 **Notes**  
  
1. **Organizer:** In [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] sync, an appointment created in customer engagement apps will not result in filling in the [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] Organizer field until it is further modified in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]. This applies to Appointment, Recurring Appointment, and Service Activity. In server-side sync, a service activity created in Dynamics 365 apps will result in filling in the [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] Organizer field with the person who synchronizes this appointment.  
  
2. **Regarding:** When you do a **Set Regarding**, the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] is replaced by the name of the regarding object from customer engagement apps. Until you sync, the **Set Regarding** action in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] and in customer engagement apps apps should not change the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].

 **Notes**  
  
1. **Parent (Regarding):** When you do a **Set Regarding**, the Company field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] is replaced by the name of the regarding object from customer engagement apps. If not syncing, the set regarding action in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] and in customer engagement apps should not change the Company field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]. Users can control updating the Company field for [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] contacts in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Set personal options that affect tracking and synchronization between customer engagement apps and Outlook or Exchange](set-personal-options-affect-tracking-synchronization-between-dynamics-365-outlook-exchange.md)  
  
2. When the Contact entity is deactivated (**Status Reason: Inactive**), the [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] will have **Category [Dynamics 365] Inactive**. This is to help differentiate the inactive vs. active status from a pool of tracked [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] contacts.

 **Notes**  
  
1. **Due Date:** Includes Date and Time. When a task is created in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], the system assigns the task a reminder time. Reminder information is not synced from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] to customer engagement apps. However, when a task has Due Time set, it will be synchronized to reminder time in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
     If there is a Start Date value but no Due Date value in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date whenever you change the Start Date directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]; If there is Start Date value but no Due Date value in customer engagement apps, customer engagement apps will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date. These are controlled by [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] and customer engagement apps independently, not controlled by sync directions here.  
  
2. **Regarding:** When you do a **Set Regarding**, the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] is replaced by the name of the regarding object from customer engagement apps. Until you sync, the **Set Regarding** action in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] and in customer engagement apps should not change the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].

 **Notes**  
  
1. **Due Date:** Includes Date and Time. When a task is created in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], the system assigns the task a reminder time. Reminder information is not synced from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] to customer engagement apps. However, when a task has Due Time set, it will be synchronized to reminder time in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
     If there is a Start Date value but no Due Date value in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date whenever you change the Start Date directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]; if there is Start Date value but no Due Date value in customer engagement apps, customer engagement apps will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date. These are controlled by [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] and Dynamics 365 apps independently, not controlled by sync directions here.  
  
2. **Regarding:** When you do a **Set Regarding**, the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] is replaced by the name of the regarding object from customer engagement apps. Until you sync, the **Set Regarding** action in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] and in customer engagement apps should not change the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].

 **Notes**  
  
1. **Due Date:** Includes Date and Time. When a task is created in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], the system assigns the task a reminder time. Reminder information is not synced from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] to customer engagement apps. However, when a task has Due Time set in customer engagement apps, it will be synchronized to reminder time in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
     If there is a Start Date value but no Due Date value in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date whenever you change the Start Date directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]; if there is Start Date value but no Due Date value in customer engagement apps, customer engagement apps will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date. These are controlled by [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] and customer engagement apps independently, not controlled by sync directions here.  
  
2. **Regarding:** When you do a **Set Regarding**, the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] is replaced by the name of the regarding object from customer engagement apps. Until you sync, the **Set Regarding** action in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] and in customer engagement apps should not change the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].

 **Notes**  
  
1. **Due Date:** Includes Date and Time. When a task is created in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], the system assigns the task a reminder time. Reminder information is not synced from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] to customer engagement apps. However, when a task has Due Time set, it will be synchronized to reminder time in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
     If there is a Start Date value but no Due Date value in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date whenever you change the Start Date directly in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]; if there is Start Date value but no Due Date value in customer engagement apps, customer engagement apps will auto fill the Due Date value with the Start Date. These are controlled by [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)]/[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] and customer engagement apps independently, not controlled by sync directions here.  
  
2. **Regarding:** When you do a **Set Regarding**, the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] is replaced by the name of the regarding object from customer engagement apps. Until you sync, the **Set Regarding** action in [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-short.md)] and in customer engagement apps should not change the Regarding field in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].  
  
3. **Start Date:** When a task is created and tracked in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)], the system assigns the task a reminder time. Reminder information is not synced from [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] to customer engagement apps. However, when a task has Due Time set, it will be synchronized to Reminder Time in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)].
