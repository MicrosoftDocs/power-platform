# Support for Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

Support is available in markets where Microsoft Power Platform or Dynamics 365 services are offered. Some specific services might not be covered in all regions immediately after general availability (GA).

Support for billing and subscription management-related issues as well as technical break-fix issues is available at all support levels. Advisory, escalation and account management services are available at the Professional Direct and Microsoft Unified support levels.

Products and services covered include:

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform services released to General Availability and purchased from Microsoft are covered by all support plans.
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Public previews are covered by all support plans.
- Support for services purchased through another channel (other than purchased online, for example, Enterprise Agreement) are governed by the agreement terms for that purchase.
