# Support for Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

Support is available in markets where Microsoft Power Platform or Dynamics 365 services are offered. Some specific services might not be covered in all regions immediately after general availability (GA).

Support for billing and subscription management-related issues and technical break-fix issues is available at all support levels. Advisory, escalation, and account management services are available at the Professional Direct and Microsoft Unified support levels.

Products and services covered include:

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform services released to General Availability and purchased from Microsoft are covered by all support plans.
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Public previews are covered by all support plans.
- Support for services purchased through another channel (other than purchased online, for example, Enterprise Agreement) are governed by the agreement terms for that purchase.

## Severity and responsiveness
Initial Response Time is the period from when you submit your support request to when a Microsoft Support Engineer contacts you and starts working on your support request. The Initial Response Time varies with both the support plan and the Business Impact of the request (also known as Severity). The Initial Response Times for Unified Support plans can be found in [Unified Enterprise Plan Details](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-unified/plan-details).

## Technical support vs. advisory services
- Technical support Break-fix issues are technical problems you experience while using services. "Break-fix" is an industry term that refers to "work involved in supporting a technology when it fails in the normal course of its function, which requires intervention by a support organization to be restored to working order."
- How functionality works isn't considered a break-fix issue but is more closely related to training. These "how-to" questions - or Advisory services - involve a transfer of knowledge and can often be answered by reviewing product documentation, raising a question in online community forums, or contacting a knowledgeable individual such as a partner. While there might be some elements of knowledge transfer involved in solving a break-fix issue, in general, assisted training isn't included in support plans.

### What is a preview (beta) service or feature?
Microsoft may provide access to Dynamics 365 apps preview, beta, or other prerelease features, services, software, or regions, to obtain feedback and for evaluation purposes. There are many different kinds of preview services and features, with service availability and program access being the biggest differentiators:

- **Public Preview**: Made available to subscribers through the Power Platform admin center or Lifecycle Services, these services are intended to give subscribers an early look into what is coming and a chance to test upcoming services and features.
- **Private Preview**: Provided only to a small subset of customers, in direct contact with the engineering teams, focused on direct and constant feedback during the development phase of a service.
- **Limited Preview**: A fixed and limited number of customers can have access to this preview program, and once a maximum threshold is met, no more users are allowed into the program.

When Microsoft offers you early access to Dynamics 365 apps preview services and features, these preview services and features are subject to reduced or different service terms as set forth in your service agreement and the preview supplemental terms. Preview services and features are provided "as-is," "with all faults," and "as available," and are excluded from the Service SLAs or any Limited Warranties provided by Microsoft for services released to general availability (GA), and are made available to you on the condition that you agree to these terms of use, which supplement your agreement governing use of customer engagement apps.

### Do support plans cover preview (beta) services or features?
- Support for Dynamics 365 apps services and features is provided only for "generally available" programsâ€”see the previous question. Public preview and/or beta services may be supported through our [forums](https://community.dynamics.com/) or other channels.
- Any technical support for a public preview service or feature is limited to break-fix scenarios and is available only in English with no around the clock support available.
