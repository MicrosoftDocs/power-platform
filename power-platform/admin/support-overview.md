# Support for Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps

Support is available in markets where Microsoft Power Platform or Dynamics 365 services are offered. Some specific services aren't covered in all regions immediately after general availability.

Support for billing, subscription management issues, and technical break-fix issues is available at all support levels. Advisory, escalation, and account management services are available at the Professional Direct and Microsoft Unified Support levels.

Products and services covered are:

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform services that are released to general availability and purchased from Microsoft are covered by all support plans.
- Public previews of Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform are covered by all support plans.
- Support for services purchased through another channel, such as an Enterprise Agreement, is governed by the agreement terms for that purchase.

## Severity and responsiveness

_Initial response time_ is the period from when you submit your support request to when a Microsoft Support engineer contacts you and starts working on your support request. The initial response time depends on the support plan and the business impact of the request (also called _severity_). The initial response times for Unified Support plans can be found in [Unified Enterprise Plan Details](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-unified/plan-details).

| Severity level | Customer's situation | Initial response time | Expected customer response | 
|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------|----------------------------|
| Severity A | **Critical business impact**<br><br>Customer’s business has significant loss or degradation of services and requires immediate attention.| Standard: Less than one hour<br><br>ProDirect: Less than one hour<br><br>Unified enterprise: Less than one hour<br><br>24x7 access| When you select Severity A, you confirm that the issue has critical business impact, with severe loss and degradation of services.<br><br>The issue demands an immediate response, and you commit to continuous, 24x7 operation, every day with the Microsoft team until resolution, otherwise, Microsoft may at its discretion decrease the severity to level B.<br><br>You also ensure that Microsoft has your accurate contact information.|
| Severity B | **Moderate business impact**<br><br>Customer’s business has moderate loss or degradation of services, but work can reasonably continue in an impaired manner.| Standard: Less than four hours<br><br>ProDirect: Less than two hours<br><br>Unified enterprise: Less than two hours<br><br>Business hours access (24x7 access available)| When you select Severity B, you confirm that the issue has moderate impact to your business with loss and degradation of services, but workarounds allow reasonable, albeit temporary, business continuity.<br><br>The issue demands an urgent response. If you chose 24x7 when you submit the support request, you commit to a continuous, 24x7 operation, every day with the Microsoft team until resolution, otherwise, Microsoft may at its discretion decrease the severity to level C. If you chose business-hours support when you submit a Severity B incident, Microsoft contacts you during business hours only.<br><br>You also ensure that Microsoft has your accurate contact information.|
| Severity C | **Minimum business impact**<br><br>Customer’s business is functioning with minor impediments of services.| Standard: Less than eight hours<br><br>ProDirect: Less than four hours<br><br>Unified enterprise: Less than four hours<br><br>Business hours access| When you select Severity C, you confirm that the issue has minimum impact to your business with minor impediment of service.<br><br>For a Severity C incident, Microsoft contacts you during business hours only.<br><br>You also ensure that Microsoft has your accurate contact information.|

Keep the following information in mind:

- Based on 24x7 in English for Severity A and B.  For other languages and severities, local language support provided during local business hours. Local languages available are: English, Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese, and Japanese. Translation services may be available for other languages outside of business hours.
- Microsoft might downgrade the severity level if the customer can't provide adequate resources or responses to let Microsoft continue resolving the problem. Other situations where Microsoft might downgrade severity include requests for RCA (Root Cause Analysis), issues with customized processes or code, and tickets with proposed resolutions pending customer action.
- For most countries, business hours are 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM on weekdays (excluding weekends and holidays). In North America, business hours are 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM Pacific time, Monday to Friday, excluding holidays. In Japan, business hours are from 9:00 AM to 5:30 PM weekdays.

## Technical support vs. advisory services

- Technical support involves _break-fix_ issues, which are technical problems you experience while using services. _Break-fix_ refers to _work involved in supporting a technology when it fails during normal use and requires intervention by a support organization to restore it to working order_.
- Understanding how functionality works isn't a break-fix issue but is related to training. These _how-to_ questions, or advisory services, involve knowledge transfer and can often be answered by reviewing product documentation, asking questions in online forums, or contacting a knowledgeable partner. While there might be some elements of knowledge transfer involved in solving a break-fix issue, in general, assisted training isn't included in support plans.

### What is a preview (beta) service or feature?

Microsoft might provide access to Dynamics 365 apps preview, beta, or other prerelease features, services, software, or regions to gather feedback and for evaluation. There are many different kinds of preview services and features, with service availability and program access being the biggest differentiators:

- **Public preview**: Made available to subscribers through the Power Platform admin center or Lifecycle Services, these services are intended to give subscribers an early look into what is coming and a chance to test upcoming services and features.
- **Private preview**: Provided only to a small subset of customers, in direct contact with the engineering teams, focused on direct and constant feedback during the development phase of a service.
- **Limited preview**: A fixed and limited number of customers can have access to this preview program, and once a maximum threshold is met, no more users are allowed into the program.

When Microsoft offers early access to Dynamics 365 apps preview services and features, these are subject to reduced or different service terms as defined in your service agreement and the preview supplemental terms. Preview services and features are provided _as-is_, _with all faults_, and _as available_. They are excluded from the Service SLAs or any limited warranties provided by Microsoft for services released to general availability (GA) and are available only if you agree to these terms of use, which supplement your agreement governing customer engagement apps.

### Do support plans cover preview (beta) services or features?

- Support for Dynamics 365 apps services and features is available only for generally available programs. Public preview and beta services might be supported through [forums](https://community.dynamics.com/) or other channels.
- Any technical support for a public preview service or feature is limited to break-fix scenarios and is available only in English with no around the clock support available.

## Using Support

### How do I get support if I don't have a subscription yet and get an error message while creating one?

You can open a Subscription Management support request through the [Microsoft 365 Admin Portal](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/?auth=2&origindomain=microsoft365), as long as you have a Power Platform admin sign-in credential to the portal. To open a Subscription Management support request, sign in to the [Microsoft 365 Admin Portal](https://m365.cloud.microsoft/chat/?auth=2), select the Admin app, and then select the **Support – New Support Request** option from the left navigation. This provides access to the **Need Help?** pane, where you can type your Subscription Management question. If the recommended articles don't address your issue, select the **Contact Support** link at the bottom of the **Need Help?** pane, and provide the additional information needed to submit the support request.

### Who can submit a support request in the Power Platform admin center?

Any users with the Power Platform admin roles, on the tenant containing the subscriptions, can submit a support request. End users can't open support requests and must have their permissions elevated within the tenant to do this. There's no alternative to this experience.

### How do I authorize another person to submit support requests for a particular subscription in the Power Platform admin center?

To grant permission, you must have a Power Platform admin role on the tenant that contains the subscription. Assign the Service Administrator role to users who want to create and manage support requests for that tenant but don't need other permissions. [Learn more](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) about role assignments in the portal.

### I'm developing applications on behalf of my client or assisting my client who is running customer engagement apps. How do I get support in the Power Platform admin center?

You can get support in two ways:

- Being an administrator of your customer's tenant, you can use or purchase a Support plan for that account, as any subscription you own under the same account is covered by the same support plan. You can also use your Partner benefits (for example, Advanced Support for Partners or Microsoft Partner Network Support) to submit a support request.

- Get support using your customer's account. To do so, the partner (you) must have administrator or owner privileges to the customer's subscription, most often through being a delegated administrator on the tenant. The Partner can then use the customer's subscription, or the Partner can use their Support Benefits (for example, Advanced Support for Partners or Microsoft Partner Network Support) to submit a support request.

### I'm running a non-Microsoft technology with Dynamics 365 apps or a custom application built using Open Source Software (OSS). Does my plan support it?

- Microsoft offers customers the ability to run non-Microsoft technologies along with Dynamics 365 apps. For all scenarios that are eligible for support through a Support plan, Microsoft Support helps in isolating the issue between the environment and your custom application.

- Full technical support is provided if the issue is caused by a service or platform. Commercially reasonable support is provided to all other scenarios. When an adequate solution to your issue isn't achieved, you might be referred to other support channels that are available for the non-Microsoft software.

### Which support plan do I need in order to request a Root Cause Analysis (RCA)?

Technical support doesn't conduct RCAs as part of any support experience.

If any RCA is conducted, the engineering team conducts the RCA. RCAs are only provided to published service-related incidents when multiple customers or services aren't available. Any RCA created can be provided directly to the customer through the support request, published through the Microsoft 365 Service health dashboard, or delivered by an account contact.

RCAs aren't sent directly to Power Platform admins. Published RCAs are only available in English. Any other request for an RCA to a specific scenario impacting your tenant, won't be honored by the engineering team.

### How is support provided for performance issues?

Depending on the situation, performance issues may be handled through a normal reactive break-fix support case or could require an advisory service at the discretion of the Microsoft Dynamics support team. For performance issues having impact in multiple areas of the business, an advisory service is required to investigate at a broader level. For isolated performance issues impacting a specific business function, such as posting sales orders, these scenarios start as a break-fix support case to troubleshoot to determine the cause. The Microsoft Dynamics support team invests up to four hours of time on a break-fix case to assist. If after four hours the issue isn't resolved, consult a partner or the community forums for further investigation. The technical support incident is then closed. Premier and Unified Support customers may be able to continue via an advisory case. If, at any point it's determined that the cause points to custom code, partner or ISV software, something environmental, or anything else outside of core Microsoft code, the Microsoft Dynamics Support team provides evidence that supports this in order for the customer or partner to proceed with further investigation and resolution of the problem.

### Does Microsoft provide support for data corruption?

Data may become corrupt due to various reasons, such as malfunctioning software, custom code, partner or ISV software, or power outages. Microsoft doesn't help correct damaged data. Per the Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA), Microsoft doesn't have a legal obligation to change or correct data being corrupted due to malfunctioning software. Microsoft may execute scripts provided by partners or customers in the production environment if the script was tested in the UAT environment by the partner or customer prior.

### What happens if the issue can't be reproduced or has to do with customized databases or customization?

In scenarios where a problem isn't able to be reproduced in a standard nonmodified Dynamics installation, the Microsoft Dynamics support team invests best effort support up to four hours of time on a break-fix case to assist. If after four hours, we haven't yet identified the repro steps of an issue, consulting a partner or the community forums is recommended for further investigation and the technical support incident is closed.

### Can a support incident be reopened?

- If the software and hardware remain the same—for example, if the product build number is the same and no new security updates, patches, or hotfixes have been installed—a support incident can be reopened. If the build is different, submit a new support incident.

- If the error or problem occurring is the same as the original incident, and it occurs on the same environment/machine/document as the original incident, then a support incident can be reopened. If the error occurs on a new machine/for a different user/different document, submit a new support incident.

- If a new error occurs after installing a hotfix or trying some suggestions from the original incident, it's treated as a new error and hence needs a new support incident.

- If a case has been closed three or more months, submit a new support incident.
