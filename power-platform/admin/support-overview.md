# Support for Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

Support is available in markets where Microsoft Power Platform or Dynamics 365 services are offered. Some specific services might not be covered in all regions immediately after general availability (GA).

Support for billing and subscription management-related issues and technical break-fix issues is available at all support levels. Advisory, escalation, and account management services are available at the Professional Direct and Microsoft Unified support levels.

Products and services covered include:

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform services released to General Availability and purchased from Microsoft are covered by all support plans.
- Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Public previews are covered by all support plans.
- Support for services purchased through another channel (other than purchased online, for example, Enterprise Agreement) are governed by the agreement terms for that purchase.

## Severity and responsiveness
Initial Response Time is the period from when you submit your support request to when a Microsoft Support Engineer contacts you and starts working on your support request. The Initial Response Time varies with both the support plan and the Business Impact of the request (also known as Severity). The Initial Response Times for Unified Support plans can be found in [Unified Enterprise Plan Details](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-unified/plan-details).

## Resources

## Technical support vs. advisory services
- Technical support Break-fix issues are technical problems you experience while using services. "Break-fix" is an industry term that refers to "work involved in supporting a technology when it fails in the normal course of its function, which requires intervention by a support organization to be restored to working order."
- How functionality works isn't considered a break-fix issue but is more closely related to training. These "how-to" questions - or Advisory services - involve a transfer of knowledge and can often be answered by reviewing product documentation, raising a question in online community forums, or contacting a knowledgeable individual such as a partner. While there might be some elements of knowledge transfer involved in solving a break-fix issue, in general, assisted training isn't included in support plans.

### What is a preview (beta) service or feature?
Microsoft may provide access to Dynamics 365 apps preview, beta, or other prerelease features, services, software, or regions, to obtain feedback and for evaluation purposes. There are many different kinds of preview services and features, with service availability and program access being the biggest differentiators:

- **Public Preview**: Made available to subscribers through the Power Platform admin center or Lifecycle Services, these services are intended to give subscribers an early look into what is coming and a chance to test upcoming services and features.
- **Private Preview**: Provided only to a small subset of customers, in direct contact with the engineering teams, focused on direct and constant feedback during the development phase of a service.
- **Limited Preview**: A fixed and limited number of customers can have access to this preview program, and once a maximum threshold is met, no more users are allowed into the program.

When Microsoft offers you early access to Dynamics 365 apps preview services and features, these preview services and features are subject to reduced or different service terms as set forth in your service agreement and the preview supplemental terms. Preview services and features are provided "as-is," "with all faults," and "as available," and are excluded from the Service SLAs or any Limited Warranties provided by Microsoft for services released to general availability (GA), and are made available to you on the condition that you agree to these terms of use, which supplement your agreement governing use of customer engagement apps.

### Do support plans cover preview (beta) services or features?
- Support for Dynamics 365 apps services and features is provided only for "generally available" programs—see the previous question. Public preview and/or beta services may be supported through our [forums](https://community.dynamics.com/) or other channels.
- Any technical support for a public preview service or feature is limited to break-fix scenarios and is available only in English with no around the clock support available.

## Using Support

How do I get support if I don't have a subscription yet, and I get an error message while creating one?
You can open a Subscription Management support request through the Microsoft 365 Admin Portal, as long as you have a Power Platform admin sign-in credential to the portal. To open a Subscription Management support request, sign in to the Microsoft 365 Admin Portal, select the Admin app, and select the Support – New Support Request option from the left navigation. This provides access to the Need Help? pane, where you can type your Subscription Management question. If the recommended articles do not address your issue, select the Contact Support link at the bottom of the Need Help? pane, and provide the additional information needed to submit the support request.

Who can submit a support request in the Power Platform admin center?
Any users with the Power Platform admin roles on the tenant containing the subscriptions can submit a support request. End users are not enabled for opening a support request and will need to have their permissions elevated within the tenant to accomplish this task. There is no alternative to this experience.

How do I authorize another person to submit support requests for a particular subscription in the Power Platform admin center?
To grant permission, you must have a Power Platform admin role on the tenant that contains the subscription. Assign the Service Administrator role to all users who want to create and manage support requests for that given tenant but do not require other permissions. Learn more about role assignments in the portal.

I am developing applications on behalf of my client or assisting my client who is running customer engagement apps. How do I get support in the Power Platform admin center?
You can get support in two ways:
•	Being an administrator of your customer's tenant, you can use or purchase a Support plan for that account, as any subscription you own under the same account is covered by the same support plan. You can also use your Partner benefits (for example, Advanced Support for Partners or Microsoft Partner Network Support) to submit a support request.
•	Get support using your customer's account. To do so, the Partner (you) must have administrator or owner privileges to the customer's subscription, most often through being a Delegated Administrator on the tenant. The Partner can then use the customer's subscription, or the Partner can use their Support Benefits (for example, Advanced Support for Partners or Microsoft Partner Network Support) to submit a support request.



I'm running a non-Microsoft technology with Dynamics 365 apps or a custom application built using Open Source Software (OSS). Does my plan support it?
•	Microsoft offers customers the ability to run non-Microsoft technologies along with Dynamics 365 apps. For all scenarios that are eligible for support through a Support plan, Microsoft Support will help in isolating the issue between the environment and your custom application.
•	Full technical support will be provided if the issue is determined to be caused by a service or platform. Commercially reasonable support will be provided to all other scenarios. When an adequate solution to your issue is not achieved, you might be referred to other support channels that are available for the non-Microsoft software.


Which support plan do I need in order to request a Root-Cause Analysis (RCA)?
Technical support does not conduct RCAs as part of any support experience. If any RCA is conducted, the engineering team will conduct the RCA. RCAs are only provided to published service-related incidents when multiple customers or services are not available. Any RCA created will be published through the Microsoft 365 Message center and will not be emailed directly to Power Platform admins. These published RCAs are only available in English. Any other request for an RCA to a specific scenario impacting your tenant will not be honored by the engineering team.

How is support provided for Performance issues?
Depending on the situation, performance issues may be handled via a normal reactive break fix support case or could require an advisory service at the discretion of the Microsoft Dynamics support team. For performance issues having impact in multiple areas of the business, an advisory service is required to investigate at a broader level. For isolated performance issues impacting a specific business function (i.e. Posting Sales Orders), these scenarios will start as a break-fix support case to troubleshoot to determine the cause. The Microsoft Dynamics support team will invest up to 4 hours of time on a break fix case to assist. If after 4 hours, we have not yet resolved the issue, consulting a partner or the community forums will be recommended for further investigation and the technical support incident will be closed. Premier/Unified Support customers may be able to continue via an advisory case. If at any point it is determined that the cause points to custom code, partner or ISV software, something environmental or anything else outside of core Microsoft code, the Microsoft Dynamics Support team will provide evidence that supports this in order for the Customer/Partner to proceed with further investigation and resolution of the problem.

Does Microsoft provide support for Data Corruption?
Data may become corrupt due to a variety of reasons (malfunctioning software, custom code, partner or ISV software, power outages, etc.). Microsoft does not provide assistance for correcting damaged data. Note that per the Service Provider License Agreement (SPLA), Microsoft does not have a legal obligation to change or correct data being corrupted due to malfunctioning software. Microsoft may execute scripts provided by partners/customers in the production environment if the script was tested in the UAT environment by the partner/customer prior.

What happens if the issue can't be reproduced or has to do with customized databases or customization?
In scenarios where a problem is not able to be reproduced in a standard non-modified Dynamics installation, the Microsoft Dynamics support team will invest best effort support up to 4 hours of time on a break fix case to assist. If after 4 hours, we have not yet identified the repro steps of an issue, consulting a partner or the community forums will be recommended for further investigation and the technical support incident will be closed.


Can a support incident be reopened?
1.	If the Software and Hardware remains the same – example product build number, no new security updates or patches have been installed or no new hotfixes have been installed. If the build is different, submit a new support incident.
2.	If the error/Problem occurring is the same as the original incident and it occurs on the same environment/machine/document as the original incident. If the error occurs on a new machine/for a different user/different document – submit a new support incident.
3.	If a new error occurs after installing a hotfix or trying some suggestions from the original incident, it will be treated as a new error and hence needs a new support incident.
4.	If a case has been closed three or more months it is recommended to submit a new support incident as the details have likely changed in that time frame.
