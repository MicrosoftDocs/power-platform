# View Power Automate audit logs

You can find logs of Power Automate activities in the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/). These logs are also accessible to developers via the [Office 365 Management API](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-apis-overview).

## Access the logs

1. Sign into the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/) as a tenant admin.
1. In the left hamburger menu, select **Show all**.
1. Select **Audit** from the **Solutions** category.

Power Platform admins can search the **Audit** screen for details from the following popular services.

- Power BI
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Microsoft Teams
- Dynamics 365
- Power Apps
- Power Automate
- Dataverse

Admins can filter for specific activities via the **Activities** list. You'll find the Power Automate activities in this list.

## See audited events

All logging is done at the SDK layer, so a single action can trigger multiple logged events. Here's a list of events that you can audit.

|Trials | Renewed a paid trial | When a user renews a paid trial.|

## Retention

Microsoft retains the audit data for 90 days. You can export the audit data in .csv format and then further explore the data with Microsoft Excel or Power BI.

## Timing

## Limitations

Only activity from cloud flows is available in the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com/). Activity for desktop flows is in the Microsoft Dataverse audit logs.
