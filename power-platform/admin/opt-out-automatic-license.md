# Opt-out of automatic license-based user roles management 
 

## How to request my organization opt-outs?

Submit a [support ticket](get-help-support.md) requesting to turn off the automatic license-based user role management for your environment/organization or tenant. Include the information of your [organization unique name or ID](determine-org-id-name.md) and your tenant ID (**portal.azure.com** > under **Azure services** > **Tenant properties**).

## What to expect once the automatic role assignment is turned off for your organization

- System will no longer be automatically adding or removing the roles from users based on the licenses assigned to them.
- Only license-based roles will be impacted by this setting. Default security roles or any other roles management will continue to behave like they currently do.
- Existing license-based roles assigned to users in the system will not be altered with this setting. 
- Once the feature for auto management is turned off, it canâ€™t be re-enabled for auto management.

## How do users get these roles that used to be automatically added or removed once opted-out?

Administrators can add and remove the appropriate roles to users through the Power Platform admin center.

## Does this impact the "Default" environment too?
For the "Default" environment, Environment Maker and Basic User roles will continue to be automatically assigned to users even after opt-out.
