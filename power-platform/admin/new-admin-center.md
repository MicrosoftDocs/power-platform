## When and how can customers benefit from the new experience?

All customers can access the public preview of the new Power Platform admin center starting November 24, 2024. Customers in some regions might have earlier access.  

To start using it, turn on the **Try the new admin center** toggle in the upper-right corner of the current admin center.

After you turn on the toggle, you can explore the new interface with its logically organized pages. To revert to the classic admin center, turn off the toggle at any time.

## Where are pages from the classic admin center in the new one?

## What else is included in the new admin center?

In addition to reorganized pages based on admin tasks, we're introducing a new *monitoring pages* experience. Monitoring pages allow admins and makers to track performance statistics in their tenant, helping them identify app accessibility problems or slow-loading Power Pages sites.  

These new experiences help you measure and improve the operational health of your organizational resources such as apps. They provide insights into overall operational health in a tenant or specific environments. Metrics are derived from aggregated event logs of runtime activities, with recommendations based on these logs or static analysis of resource properties. Event logs used for metric calculations are available for review and download for further analysis.

## What's next?

Over the coming months, we'll add more features to assist admins with day-to-day tasks, including application lifecycle management. Stay tuned for more information!
