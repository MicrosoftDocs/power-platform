# Tenant-level analytics for Power Apps

Tenant-level analytics allow Power Platform admins to extract key service metrics based on user adoption across the environments they manage. Tailor made analytics are contained within reports embedded in Power Platform admin center. 

The following tenant-level reports are available for Power Apps. 

## Power Apps - Usage reports

Power Apps reports provide insights into tenant and environment usage and inventory of all apps and connectors. The report answers questions such as:

- What is the count of unique canvas/model-driven apps users across the tenant or environments? 
- What is the count of first-time users across canvas and model-driven apps?
- How many apps exist in my tenant or environment?
- Which of my environments had the most unique users? 
- What were the top apps by unique users/app sessions?
