# Enable SharePoint document management for specific entities

Store the documents related to entity records in [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] and quickly access, share, and manage these documents from customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), by enabling document management on the specific entities.  
  
> [!TIP]
> If you haven't set up server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration, you may want to do that before enabling document management for specific entities. For more information, see [Set up SharePoint integration](set-up-sharepoint-integration.md).  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin.md)] Or verify that you have Read and Write privileges on all record types that are customizable.  
  
   Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. In the Microsoft Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

3. Select **Settings** > **Integration** > **Document management settings** > **Document Management Settings**.  

4. Select the entities that you want to use to manage [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] documents.  
  
   If a URL is not already specified, enter the URL of the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site where the document locations and folders for storing documents will be created, and then select **Next**.  
  
5. Consider these server-based integration settings.
  
   - Check **Based on entity** to have  document libraries and folders that are based on the Account entity automatically  created on the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site. Users will not be prompted to create them.  
  
    If you don't want folders automatically created, clear the **Based on entity** check box.  
   
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    >  If you have customer engagement apps and [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-sharepoint-online.md)], make sure the site is under the same [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] tenant as your environments.  
      
   - Select **Finish**.  
  
     For more information on server-based integration, see [Set up SharePoint integration](set-up-sharepoint-integration.md).  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - With the exception of the opportunity and contract entities, a hierarchical folder structure will not be automatically created in SharePoint for entities that have more than one many-to-one (N:1) relationship with the parent entity.
> - For document management to function correctly for an entity, the entity relationship must be one-to-many (1:N) between the entity and the SharePoint document entity. The documents that exist in the SharePoint document library will not appear in the app for entities with many-to-one (N:1) or many-to-many (N:N) relationships between the entity and a SharePoint document entity.
