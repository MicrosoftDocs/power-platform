# Manage feature settings

Use feature settings to adjust how features appear and function in Power Apps [model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview) and in Dynamics 365 model-driven apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

These settings can be found in the Power Platform admin center by going to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Features**.

Make sure you have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions to update the business closures.

**Check your security role**

- Follow the steps in [View your user profile](/powerapps/user/view-your-user-profile).
- Don’t have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> These settings may not yet be available in your environment. The settings are available depending on the region's release plan.
