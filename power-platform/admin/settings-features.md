# Manage feature settings

Use feature settings to adjust how features appear and function in Power Apps [model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview) and in Dynamics 365 model-driven apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service.

These settings can be found in the Power Platform admin center by going to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Features**.

Make sure you have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions to update the business closures.

**Check your security role**

- Follow the steps in [View your user profile](/powerapps/user/view-your-user-profile).
- Don’t have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> These settings might not yet be available in your environment. The settings availability depends on the region's release plan.

> |--------------|-----------------|  
> |AI Builder  |   |
> |AI Builder preview models  | Default: On. If **Off**, the environment will not have access to AI Builder. Not all environments will have this setting. For information about environments eligible for this feature and related details, see [Administer AI Builder](/ai-builder/administer)  |
> |**Embedded content**||  
> |Power BI visualization embedding|Default: Off. More information: [Add or edit Power BI visualizations on your dashboard](/powerapps/user/add-powerbi-dashboards)|  
> |Bing Maps|Default: Off. If **On**, Customer Engagement (on-premises) users will need to enter a Bing Maps key. Users don’t need to enter a key. |  
> |Prevent social data in Dynamics|Default: Off. If you don’t want to receive social data in customer engagement apps (such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service), select **Off**. If you disable social engagement, your organization will not be able to receive social data in customer engagement apps (such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service). Users can continue to work with existing social data, however.|
> |**Power BI components**  ||
> |Allow creation of Power BI components  | Default: On. If **Off**, the environment will not have access to Power BI. Environments with a Dataverse database will have this setting. Creating a Power BI component will generate a dedicated Power BI workspace for that environment. All the Power BI artifacts corresponding to the Power BI components created in an environment will be generated in that dedicated Power BI environment workspace. See [Permission sync between Power Apps environment and Power BI workspace](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/customize-manage-powerbi-components#permission-sync-between-power-apps-environment-and-power-bi-workspace) for more information. |
> |Automatically assign permission to Power BI workspaces |Default: On. If **On**, synchronization will take place between pre-defined role privileges and the permissions of the dedicated Power BI environment workspace. The following roles will be assigned with permissions:<br/><br/>System administrator:Power BI workspace admin > Power BI workspace admin permission.<br/><br/> System Customizer:Power BI workspace contributor > Power BI workspace contributor permission.<br/><br/> Power BI workspace viewer > Power BI workspace viewer permission.<br/><br/> [Learn more about Power BI workspace permission](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-roles-new-workspaces#workspace-roles). |
> |Allow information sharing between this environment and Power BI workspaces in other geographic regions |Default: On. When this setting is **On** and the Power BI tenant setting **[Power Platform interregional access](/power-bi/admin/service-admin-portal-integration#power-platform-interregional-access)** is also **On**, cross-geo operations can take place.

> |Show the Edit filters button on views | Default: On. If **On**, users can create personal views by filtering data based on conditional expressions starting with a view accessible to them in a model-driven app. More information: [Edit filters on a grid page](/powerapps/user/grid-filters-advanced#filter-editor). This setting only appears if you have enabled 2022 Release Wave 1.|
> |**Advanced find options**||
