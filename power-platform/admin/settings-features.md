# Manage feature settings

Use feature settings to adjust how features appear and function in Power Apps [canvas apps](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/getting-started) and [model-driven apps](/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-overview).

These settings can be found in the Power Platform admin center by going to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Features**.

To update the business closures, make sure you have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions.

**Check your security role**

- Follow the steps in [View your user profile](/powerapps/user/view-your-user-profile).
- Don't have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.

> [!NOTE]
> These settings might not yet be available in your environment. The settings availability depends on the region's release plan.
