# Administer the catalog

The catalog in Power Platform enables developers and makers to:

- Crowd-source and find templates and components within their environment easily.
- Find and install the latest and authoritative version of a component.
- Get started with templates and components that provide immediate value.

Administering the catalog includes the following tasks:

- [Set up the catalog](#set-up-the-catalog)
- [Approve and reject submission requests](#approve-and-reject-submission-requests)
- [Review install history](#review-install-history)
- [Review catalog items](#review-catalog-items)
- [Review errors in submission requests](#review-errors-in-submission-requests)
- [Review errors in install requests](#review-errors-in-install-requests)
- [Edit user access](#edit-user-access)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You need a Managed Environment in order to submit items to the catalog. You can however install catalog items from any environment. More information: [Managed Environments overview](managed-environment-overview.md)

## Access controls

The catalog has a separate set of access controls from Power Platform. This means makers in a given environment don't automatically get permissions to publish and acquire items from the catalog. There are four security roles:

|Role|Enables user to:|
|---------|---------|
|**Catalog Submitter**|Submit items to the catalog|
|**Catalog Read-Only Member**|Discover and install items from the catalog|
|**Catalog Approver**|Approve submissions to the catalog.<br />Catalog approvers can be users from your central IT department or line of business that your organization wants to empower to participate in the approvals process.|
|**Catalog Administrator**|Can administer the catalog.|

Any environment that has a catalog has these roles that can be viewed from the Power Platform admin center, and can be [assigned to groups or individuals](../admin/security-roles-privileges.md) just like any other security role.

Power Platform admins and system customizers already have full access to the catalog. However, don't assign these roles for generally managing catalog access, and instead use one of the roles mentioned in the previous table.

## Set up the catalog

Before you can administer the catalog, you must install and configure it. Most organizations should be fine with just one catalog in their tenant. All environments in a tenant can install catalog items from a single catalog. But some organizations might want to have different catalogs for regions, departments, or other grouping.

To set up a catalog, go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) for your tenant, and expand **Resources** and then select **Catalogs**.

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-catalog.png" lightbox="media/admin-catalog.png" alt-text="Catalog in the Power Platform admin center":::

Select **New catalog** in the top menu or in the page itself brings up a setup wizard that has seven steps.

### Step 1: Setup

Enter the following information:

|Field|Description|
|---------|---------|
|**Name**|Enter a name for the catalog|
|**Language**|Set the language for your users of the catalog|
|**Description**|Add some details that help others understand what this catalog is for|
|**Region**|What region this catalog is for, which will filter the available environments|
|**Environment**|Which environment in your tenant you want the catalog to be installed for (ensure some environments have been set up for you to select)|
|**Status**|Uncheck this box if you want the catalog inactive after setting up|

### Step 2: Select catalog administrators

Select up to 10 Microsoft Entra ID groups who can administer the catalog.  Ensure you have created some Microsoft Entra ID groups for your users.

### Step 3: Select approvers

By default, catalog item submissions must be approved by an approver or admin. Check the box if you want your tenant to allow submissions to be autoapproved.

Select up to 10 Microsoft Entra ID groups who can approve catalog items before they're submitted into the catalog. More information: [Approve and reject submission requests](#approve-and-reject-submission-requests)

### Step 4: Select submitters

Select up to 10 Microsoft Entra ID groups who can submit catalog items to the catalog.

### Step 5: Select consumers

Select up to 10 Microsoft Entra ID groups who can view and install catalog items from the catalog.

### Step 6: Select categories

Select which business categories you would like to allow makers to use when submitting catalog items. These categories also show up in the filters for the discover page to help makers find the catalog items they want. You can also add your own business categories as well.

### Step 7: Review and create the catalog

This last step summarizes everything you just set up. If everything looks good, select the **terms and conditions** link to review, and if agreeable, just check the box and select **Create catalog** to finish setup.


### Next steps
  
You can add more catalogs to your tenant at any time by going through this wizard again and selecting a different environment to create a new catalog.

After the process is complete, you can access the Power Platform Catalog Manager from the same **Catalogs** screen under **Resources** in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

In addition, When successfully completed, the **Power Platform Catalog Manager** appears in the **Apps** area in Power Apps (make.powerapps.com). The Power Platform Catalog Manager is where you perform all your administrative tasks. The below sections are all performed inside the Power Platform Catalog Manager.

Repeat this process if you would like to set up a catalog in more environments.

## Approve and reject submission requests

Environment admins and users with the Catalog Approver role can review new submissions and approve or decline requests. If global auto approval or publisher level auto approval is turned on, then there's no requirement for manual review and approval.

In the **Approvals** section of the navigation pane, select **Requests**.
This list has 16 views. The most important ones are:

|View |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Active Approval Requests** (Default)|Use this view to review submission requests pending approval|
|**All Approval Request**|Use this view to review all requests across all statuses|
|**Failed Pre-Validation**|Use this view to identify requests where a submitter has sent a request but it isn't available in the **Active Approval Requests** view. This view can help with troubleshooting such scenarios.|
|**Approved Approval Request**|Use this view to review previously approved requests|

Using the **Active Approval Requests** view, open a request and select **Resolve Request** in the menu.

- Select **Reject Request** to decline the request. The request is archived and publisher, item, and asset aren't created.
- Select **Complete Request** to approve. Upon approval, publisher, item, and assets are created. The request is archived to **Inactive** status.

## Review install history

- **Pending Approval**
- **Published** (Default) This view shows the most recent version of the item.

These views show the following columns:

|Column|Description|
|---------|---------|
|**Name (Publishers)** |Name of the publisher|
|**Name**|Display Name|
|**Catalog Item Id**|ID provided by publisher|
|**Engineering Contact**|The engineering contact|

|**Allow Auto-Approval**|By enabling auto approval at the publisher level, future submissions from this publisher are auto approved. Admins can use this strategy in scenarios where there's a trusted party within their organization that they trust implicitly and don't require approvals from. Also, auto approval can be turned on globally across all publishers here.|
