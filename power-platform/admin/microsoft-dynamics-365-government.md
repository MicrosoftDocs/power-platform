# Dynamics 365 US Government  

In response to the unique and evolving requirements of the United States public sector, Microsoft has created Microsoft Dynamics 365 US Government that is available to qualified government tables in the United States. On October 11, 2016, Microsoft announced the next generation of intelligent business applications in the cloud under the brand Microsoft Dynamics 365. To this end, Microsoft Dynamics 365 US Government entails a continuity of the protected environment that was originally branded Microsoft CRM Online Government where the protections afforded to the government community cloud under the new brand are represented by eight discrete functions: 

- Customer Service
- Customer Voice
- Field Service 
- Finance
- Guides
- Omnichannel Engagement Hub
- Project Service Automation
- Remote Assist on HoloLens or HoloLens 2
- Sales
- Supply Chain Management

## Dynamics 365 US Government feature limitations

Microsoft strives to maintain functional parity between our commercially available services and those enabled though our U.S. Government clouds, specifically:

- US Government Community Cloud (GCC)
- US GC High
- US Department of Defense (US DoD)

There are exceptions to the principle of maintaining product functional parity within the U.S. Government clouds. These exceptions are highlighted through the [Product and Feature Availability](https://aka.ms/bapfunctionalparity) document, and intended to help customers understand and plan for successful implementations of their business application solutions. Microsoft continues to evaluate these services and capabilities for inclusion and updates in future releases.  Check back on a monthly basis for important updates and revisions. Refer to the [Global Geographic Availability](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/geographic-availability/) tool to see where the Dynamics 365 Apps and Offers are available throughout the world, including approximate availability timelines. 

## About Dynamics 365 US Government environments and products

Select Dynamics 365 US Government products are Generally Available to customers through deployment into the Government Community Cloud (GCC).  Among other compliance commitments and reviews as documented in the Microsoft Trust Center, the service has received several agency Authority to Operate (ATOs) since it was originally launched in January, 2015. Microsoft is the first Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) to achieve a FedRAMP Joint Application Board Provisional Authority to Operate (JAB P-ATO) through the JAB Accelerated Process. In March, 2018, the service impact level was granted a FedRAMP JAB High P-ATO.

As of April, 2019, eligible customers may choose to deploy select Dynamics 365 US Government products to the “**GCC High**” environment, which enables single sign-on and seamless integration with Microsoft 365 GCC High deployments. Microsoft has designed the platform and our operational procedures to meet the requirements aligning with the DISA SRG IL4 compliance framework. We anticipate our US Department of Defense contractor customer base and other Federal agencies currently leveraging Microsoft 365 GCC High to use the Dynamics 365 US Government GCC High deployment option, which enables and requires the customer to leverage Microsoft Entra Government for customer identities, in contrast to GCC which leverages Public Microsoft Entra ID. For our US Department of Defense contractor customer base, Microsoft operates the service in a manner that enables these customers to meet ITAR commitment and DFARS acquisition regulations, as documented and required by their contracts with the US Department of Defense.

Beginning April, 2021, eligible customers may choose to deploy select Dynamics 365 US Government products to the “**DoD**” environment, which enables single sign-on and seamless integration with Microsoft 365 DoD deployments. Microsoft has designed the platform and our operational procedures to meet the requirements aligning with the DISA SRG IL5 compliance framework. We anticipate our US Department of Defense customer base and other Federal agencies currently leveraging Microsoft 365 DoD to use the Dynamics 365 US Government DOD deployment option, which enables and requires the customer to leverage Microsoft Entra Government for customer identities.  Microsoft operates the service in a manner that enables these customers to meet ITAR commitment and DFARS acquisition regulations, as documented and required by their contracts with the US Department of Defense.

Select Dynamics 365 US Government products are available to qualified government and private entities, limited to (i) United States (US) federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial government entities; (ii) private entities using Dynamics 365 US Government to provide solutions to a government entities or a qualified member of the cloud community; and (iii) private entities with customer data subject to government regulations for which the use of Dynamics 365 US Government is the appropriate service to meet the regulatory requirements.

### What is “customer data” and “customer content?”

This section describes Dynamics 365 Government commitments that apply to customer content and to customer data.

Customer data, as defined in the Online Service Terms, means all data, including all text, sound, video, or image files, and software, that are provided to Microsoft by, or on behalf of, Customer through use of the Online Service. Customer content refers to a specific subset of customer data that has been directly created by users, such as content stored in databases through entries in Dynamics 365 tables (e.g. contact information). Content is generally considered confidential information, and in normal service operation, is not sent over the Internet without encryption.

For more information on the Dynamics 365 protection and treatment of customer data, see the [Microsoft Online Services Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/cloudservices/dynamics365).

### Data segregation for Government Community Cloud

When provisioned as part of Dynamics 365 Government, the Dynamics 365 service is offered in accordance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication 800-145.

In addition to the logical separation of customer content at the application layer, the Dynamics 365 Government service provides your organization with a secondary layer of physical segregation for customer content by using infrastructure that is separate from the infrastructure used for commercial Dynamics 365 customers. This includes using Azure services in Azure’s Government Cloud and Azure’s Department of Defense Cloud. To learn more, see [Azure Government](https://azure.microsoft.com/features/gov/).

### Customer content located within the United States

Dynamics 365 US Government services are provided from datacenters physically located in the United States. Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service,  Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation, Dynamics 365 Finance, and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management) customer content is stored at rest in datacenters physically located only in the US.

### Restricted data access by administrators

Access to Dynamics 365 US Government customer content by Microsoft administrators is restricted to personnel who are US citizens. These personnel undergo background investigations in accordance with relevant government standards.

Dynamics 365 support and service engineering staff do not have standing access to customer content hosted in Dynamics 365 US Government. Any staff who request temporary permission elevation which would grant access to customer content must first have passed the following background checks.

### Certifications and accreditations

Dynamics 365 US Government is designed to support the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) accreditation at a High Impact level. FedRAMP artifacts are available for review by federal customers who are required to comply with FedRAMP. Federal agencies can review these artifacts in support of their review to grant an Authority to Operate (ATO).

Dynamics 365 has been authorized as a service within the Azure Government FedRAMP ATO. More information, including how to access the FedRAMP documents, can be found in the [FedRAMP Marketplace](https://marketplace.fedramp.gov/#!/product/azure-government-includes-dynamics-365?sort=productName&productNameSearch=azure%20government).

Dynamics 365 US Government has features designed to support customer’s CJIS Policy requirements for law enforcement agencies. See the [Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/product-overview#office-CustomSpacingTemplate-pl2a7m4) for more detailed information related to certifications and accreditations.

Microsoft has designed the platform and our operational procedures to meet the requirements aligning with the DISA SRG IL4 compliance framework. We anticipate our US Department of Defense contractor customer base and other Federal agencies currently leveraging Microsoft 365 GCC High to use the Dynamics 365 US Government GCC High deployment option, which enables and requires the customer to leverage Microsoft Entra Government for customer identities, in contrast to GCC which leverages Public Microsoft Entra ID. For our US Department of Defense contractor customer base, Microsoft operates the service in a manner that enables these customers to meet ITAR commitment and DFARS acquisition regulations.

Eligible customers may choose to deploy select Dynamics 365 US Government Offers to the **“DoD”** environment, which enables single sign-on and seamless integration with Microsoft 365 DoD deployments. Microsoft has designed the platform and our operational procedures to meet the requirements aligning with the DISA SRG IL5 compliance framework. We anticipate our US Department of Defense customer base and other Federal agencies currently leveraging Microsoft 365 DoD to use the Dynamics 365 US Government DOD deployment option, which enables and requires the customer to leverage Microsoft Entra Government for customer identities.  Microsoft operates the service in a manner that enables these customers to meet ITAR commitment and DFARS acquisition regulations, as documented and required by their contracts with the US Department of Defense.

### Dynamics 365 US Government and other Microsoft services

Dynamics 365 US Government includes several features that allow users to address customer calls through Skype for Business, email editing for sales materials and, in general, integration with other Microsoft enterprise service offerings such as Microsoft 365 for Government. Dynamics 365 US Government is deployed within Microsoft datacenters in a manner consistent with a multi-tenant, public cloud deployment model; however, client applications including but not limited to the web-user client, Dynamics 365 for tablets, Dynamics 365 for phones, Dynamics 365 for Outlook, Unified Service Desk for Dynamics 365 and any third-party client application that connects to Dynamics 365 US Government are not part of Dynamics 365 US Government's accreditation boundary and government customers are responsible for managing them.

Dynamics 365 US Government leverages the Microsoft 365 customer administrator UI for customer administration and billing. Dynamic 365 US Government maintains the actual resources, information flow, and data management, while relying on Microsoft 365 to provide the visual styles that are presented to the customer administrator through their management console. For purposes of FedRAMP ATO inheritance, Dynamics 365 US Government leverages Azure (including Azure Government) ATOs for infrastructure and platform services, respectively.

### Dynamics 365 US Government and third-party services

Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps provide the ability to integrate third-party applications into the service. These third-party applications and services might involve storing, transmitting, and processing your organization’s customer data on third-party systems that are outside of the Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps Engagement infrastructure and therefore are not covered by the Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps compliance and data protection commitments. We recommend that you review the privacy and compliance statements provided by the third parties when assessing the appropriate use of these services for your organization.

### Dynamics 365 US Government and Azure Services

Microsoft Entra and Microsoft Entra Government (Microsoft Entra Government) are not part of the Dynamics 365 US Government accreditation boundary. Government customers are responsible for using ADFS to uniquely identify and authenticate their organizational users. Notwithstanding, it is important to note that Microsoft Entra and Microsoft Entra Government provide critical functionality to both Dynamics 365 US Government and ADFS, whose dependencies are described in detailed in the Dynamics 365 US Government SSP (Service Security Plan).

When a user of an organization employing ADFS attempts to access Dynamics 365, the user is redirected to a login page hosted on the organization’s ADFS server. The user provides their credentials to their organization's ADFS server, which attempts to authenticate the credentials using the organization’s existing Active Directory infrastructure. If the credentials are authenticated, the organization’s ADFS server issues a SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) ticket containing information about the user’s identity and group membership. The customer ADFS server signs this ticket using one half of an asymmetric key pair and it sends the ticket to Microsoft Entra via encrypted TLS. Microsoft Entra ID validates the signature using the other half of the asymmetric key pair and grants access based on the ticket. The user's identity and group membership information remain in an encrypted fashion in Microsoft Entra ID; in other words, limited user-identifiable information is stored in Microsoft Entra ID. Full details of the Microsoft Entra security architecture and control implementation can be found in the Azure SSP and Azure Government SSP.
