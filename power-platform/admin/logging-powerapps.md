# Power Apps activity logging

Power Apps activities are tracked from the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](/purview/purview). 

Follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft Purview compliance portal](https://compliance.microsoft.com) as a tenant admin.

2. Select **Search** > **Audit log search**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Audit log search.](media/audit-log-search.png "Audit log search")

Within the **Audit log search** screen, Power Platform admins can search audit logs across many popular services including eDiscovery, Exchange, Power BI, Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Teams, customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), and Microsoft Power Apps.

Once the **Audit log search** screen is accessed, an administrator can filter for specific activities by pulling down the **Activities** dropdown and searching for **PowerApps app activities V2**.

## What events are audited
Logging takes place at the SDK layer, which means a single action can trigger multiple events that are logged. The following are a sample of user events you can audit.

|Event  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Created app   |When the app gets created for the first time by a maker |
|Launched app    |When the app gets launched |

|Edited app    |Any updates made to the app by the maker|
|Published app     |When the app is published and is made available to others in the environment|
|Edited app permission  |Every time a user's permissions to the app is changed|
|Deleted app |When the app is deleted  |
|Marked app as Hero |Every time the app is marked as Hero  |
|Deleted app permission |Every time a user's permissions to the app is removed  |
|Removed app as Hero  |Every time the app is unset as Hero |
|Removed app as Featured    |Every time the app is unset as Featured  |
|Patched app   |Every time the app is patched|
|Deleted app version   |The version of the app when deleted|

## Schema
Schemas define which Power Apps fields are sent to the Microsoft Purview compliance portal.  Some fields are common to all applications that send audit data to Microsoft Purview, while others are specific to Power Apps activities. The value in the **PropertyCollection** field is specific to each Power Apps activity type. To identify Power Apps activities, look for nested schema property **powerplatform.analytics.resource.type** with value **PowerApp** within the **PropertyCollection** property. Below is an example of the activity-specific schema.

```

        "Name": "powerplatform.analytics.resource.power_app.display_name",
