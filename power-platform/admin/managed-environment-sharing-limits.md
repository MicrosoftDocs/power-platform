# Sharing limits (preview)

<!-- https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2194484 -->

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

In managed environments, admins can limit how broadly makers can share canvas apps. There are two sharing controls.  

| Sharing control | System behavior when selected |
| --- | --- |
| **Exclude sharing with security groups** | Makers aren't allowed to share canvas apps with any security group. Admins may share with a limit on who an app can be shared with. |
| **Limit total individuals who can be shared to** | Makers aren't allowed to share canvas apps with more people than specified. |

**Limit total individuals who can be shared to** is available only if **Exclude sharing with security groups** is selected. This is because security groups may have unbounded membership. For instance, a maker might share an app with a security group that has 5 members one day and 500 members a month later.

> [!NOTE]
> Sharing rules are enforced when makers try to share an app. Sharing rules don't change who an app has already been shared with.
>
> After sharing rules are set in the Power Platform admin center, it may take up to an hour for them to propagate and start being enforced.
>
> Sharing limits in Dataverse for Teams environments do not impact sharing to a Team when you select **Publish to Teams**. However, when a maker attempts to share with individuals or groups in a Team other than the one bound to the environment, the sharing limits are enforced. 

### Surface your organization’s governance error content 
If you specify governance error message content to appear in error messages, it will be included in the error message displayed when users observe they don’t have permission to share apps in an environment. See: [PowerShell governance error message content commands](powerapps-powershell.md#governance-error-message-content-commands).
