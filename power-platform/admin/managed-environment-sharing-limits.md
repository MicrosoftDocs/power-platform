# Limit sharing 

<!-- https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2194484 and 2211538 -->

In Managed Environments, admins can limit how broadly users can share canvas apps. To configure these rules, select a Managed Environment from the environments list in the Power Platform admin center. Then, select **Edit Managed Environments** in the command bar. The sharing rules are located in the **Limit sharing** section.

## Sharing rules

| Sharing rules | System behavior when selected |
| --- | --- |
| Don't set limits | Select to not limit sharing canvas apps. |
| Exclude sharing with security groups | Select if users aren't allowed to share canvas apps with any security groups or with everyone. |
| Limit total individuals who can be shared to | If **Exclude sharing with security groups** is selected, you can control the maximum number of users to whom a canvas app can be shared with. |

> [!NOTE]
> Sharing rules are enforced when users try to share an app. Sharing rules don't change who an app has already been shared with.
>
> After sharing rules are set in the Power Platform admin center, it may take up to an hour for them to start getting enforced.
>
> Sharing rules in Dataverse for Teams environments do not impact sharing to a Team when you select **Publish to Teams**. However, when a user attempts to share with individuals or groups in a Team other than the one bound to the environment, the sharing limits are enforced. 

If a user tries to share a canvas app that **does not** respect the sharing rules, they will be informed as depicted below.

## Surface your organizationâ€™s governance error content 
If you specify governance error message content to appear in error messages, it will be included in the error message displayed to users. See: [PowerShell governance error message content commands](powerapps-powershell.md#governance-error-message-content-commands).
