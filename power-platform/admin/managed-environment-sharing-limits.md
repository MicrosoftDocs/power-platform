# Limit sharing 

<!-- https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2194484 and 2211538 -->

In Managed Environments, admins can limit how broadly users can share canvas apps. To configure these rules, select a managed environment from the environments list in the Power Platform admin center. Then, select **Edit Managed Environments** in the command bar. The sharing rules are located in the **Limit sharing** section.

## Sharing rules

| Sharing rules | System behavior when selected |
| --- | --- |
| Don't set limits | Select to not limit sharing canvas apps. |
| Exclude sharing with security groups | Select if users aren't allowed to share canvas apps with any security groups or with everyone. |
| Limit total individuals who can be shared to | If **Exclude sharing with security groups** is selected, you can control the maximum number of users with whom a canvas app can be shared. |

> [!NOTE]
> Sharing rules are enforced when users try to share an app. Sharing rules don't change who an app already has been shared with.
>
> After sharing rules are set in the Power Platform admin center, it may take up to an hour for them to start getting enforced.
>
> Sharing rules in Dataverse for Teams environments do not impact sharing to a Team when you select **Publish to Teams**. However, when a user attempts to share with individuals or groups in a Team other than the one bound to the environment, the sharing limits are enforced. 

If a user tries to share a canvas app that contradicts the sharing rules, they will be informed as shown below.

## Use PowerShell to set sharing limits

You can also use PowerShell to set and remove sharing limits.

### Set sharing limits

Here's a PowerShell script that excludes sharing a canvas app with security groups and excludes sharing a canvas app with more than 20 individuals within a Managed Environment.

```powershell
# Retrieve the environment
$environment = Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -EnvironmentName <EnvironmentId>

# Update the Managed Environment settings
$governanceConfiguration = $environment.Internal.properties.governanceConfiguration
$governanceConfiguration.settings.extendedSettings | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name 'limitSharingMode' -Value "excludeSharingToSecurityGroups" -Force
$governanceConfiguration.settings.extendedSettings | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name 'maxLimitUserSharing' -Value "20" -Force

# Save the updated Managed Environment settings
Set-AdminPowerAppEnvironmentGovernanceConfiguration -EnvironmentName <EnvironmentId> -UpdatedGovernanceConfiguration $governanceConfiguration
```

### Remove sharing limits

Here's a PowerShell scripts that removes the sharing limits that were configured in the script above.

```powershell
# Retrieve the environment
$environment = Get-AdminPowerAppEnvironment -EnvironmentName <EnvironmentId>

# Update the Managed Environment settings
$governanceConfiguration = $environment.Internal.properties.governanceConfiguration
$governanceConfiguration.settings.extendedSettings | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name 'limitSharingMode' -Value "noLimit" -Force
$governanceConfiguration.settings.extendedSettings | Add-Member -MemberType NoteProperty -Name 'maxLimitUserSharing' -Value "-1" -Force

# Save the updated Managed Environment settings
Set-AdminPowerAppEnvironmentGovernanceConfiguration -EnvironmentName <EnvironmentId> -UpdatedGovernanceConfiguration $governanceConfiguration
```

## Surface your organizationâ€™s governance error content 
If you specify governance error message content to appear in error messages, it will be included in the error message displayed to users. See [PowerShell governance error message content commands](powerapps-powershell.md#governance-error-message-content-commands).
