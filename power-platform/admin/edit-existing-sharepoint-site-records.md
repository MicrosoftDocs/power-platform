# Edit existing SharePoint site records

Store documents related to your records in [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] folders and manage the folders and documents from within customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation). Integrating [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] document management with customer engagement apps makes it easy to access and share documents associated with your records.  
  
> [!TIP]
>  If you're using [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2013_sp_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2013-sp-shortest.md)] or later, you can take advantage of server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration between customer engagement apps and [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-sharepoint-online.md)]. Server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration provides an immersive document management experience consistent with the look and feel of customer engagement apps.  
> 
>  You can use server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration for on-premises and hybrid [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] deployments. For information about setting up server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration using a wizard, see [Set up SharePoint integration](set-up-sharepoint-integration.md)  
  
 If you have already set up SharePoint document management, and want to edit your site records, use the following procedure.  
  
## Edit site records  
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin.md)]  
  
    Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
   - Don't have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.  
  
1. In the Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

2. Select **Settings** > **Integration** > **Document management settings**.  

3. Select **[!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] Sites**.  
  
4. Select the site record you want to modify, and then select **Edit**.  
  
5. Modify any of the following settings:  
  
   - **Name**. Add or change the name for the site..  
  
   - **Owner**. By default, the person who created the site is listed as the owner of the site record.  
  
   - **Description**. Add or change the description for the site. For example, specify what documents the site contains.  
  
   - **URL Type**. Specify whether you want to add an absolute (full) or relative URL for the site.  
  
     - **Absolute URL**. To point this site record to a site collection or site in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], specify the fully qualified URL of the site collection or site. You can use this record as a parent site to create other site records with relative URLs for sites inside the site collection or sites on the same [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site.  
  
     - **Relative URL**. Use this option when you have at least one site record pointing to a site collection in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. In the **Parent Site** box, select an existing  site record. If the site record that you selected as a parent site points to a site collection on SharePoint, specify the name of an existing site in the second box. If the site record that you selected as a parent site points to a site on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)], specify the name of an existing subordinate site on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  
  
6. Select **Save**.  
  
7. Select **Save and Close**.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  To activate or deactivate a site record, on the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] Sites page, select the site record, and then in the **Records** group, select **Activate** or **Deactivate**.
