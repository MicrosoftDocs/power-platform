# View security recommendations

Power Platform Advisor enhances the security and reliability of your Power Platform tenant with actionable recommendations. These recommendations identify potential risks and guide you on how to mitigate them. View security recommendations in [Power Platform Advisor](power-platform-advisor.md) in the Power Platform admin center.

The following recommendations are grouped by resource type:

## Apps

The following recommendations relate to apps:

### Assign valid owners to apps to mitigate business continuity risks

This type of recommendation lists apps in all the Managed Environments within your Power Platform tenant that don't have a valid owner. Currently, this list contains apps active in the last 90 days.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Resources with valid owners can make necessary changes or support users when an issue arises. If an app doesn't have a valid owner, it might be a business continuity risk.

#### Supported actions for apps without owners

##### Assign to new owner

1. To assign an app to a new owner, select the app from the list.
1. Select **Assign to new owner**.
1. Enter the new owner's name in the text box near the app list and select **Assign**.

Once assigned, you see a success message and the **Action State** column for that row displays **Completed**. You can't retake actions for completed rows.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - New owner information isn't updated in the list.
> - The app is shown in the list until the next planned scan.
> - New owners don't automatically get permissions to the environment or data sources used in the app. Admins must manually give owners permission.

##### Promote co-owner to owner

With multiple co-owners of an app, admins can promote one of the co-owners to owner.

1. Select an app and select **Promote co-owner to owner**.

   If you select multiple apps, Power Platform Advisor displays any shared co-owners for the selected apps.

1. Select **Assign app** to promote the co-owner to owner for all selected apps.
