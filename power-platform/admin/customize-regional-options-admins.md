# Customize regional options 

<!-- legacy procedure -->

You can customize how numbers, currencies, times, and dates appear to everyone in your organization.  
  
Make sure you have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions to update the setting.

- Follow the steps in [View your user profile](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/basics/view-your-user-profile).
- Don't have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.
  
1. In the web app, go to **Settings** (![Settings.](media/settings-gear-icon.png "Settings")) > **Advanced Settings**.

2. Select **Settings** > **Administration**.

3. Select **System Settings**, and then select the **Formats** tab. 
  
   For [Unified Interface](about-unified-interface.md), select Settings (![Gear button.](../admin/media/selection-rule-gear.png "Gear button")) in the upper-right corner > **Advanced Settings** > **Settings** > **Administration** > **System Settings** > **Formats** tab.
  
4. Under **Synchronize items with Outlook or Exchange**, select **synchronized fields**.  

5. From the **Current Format** list, select the language and country or region, and then select **Customize**.  
  
6. In the **Customize Regional Options** dialog box, you can change the default settings for the selected format. View how the changes will look in the preview boxes.  
  
   - Select the **Number** tab to change the decimal symbol, digit grouping symbol, digit groups, and negative numbers.  
  
   - Select the **Currency** tab to change the currency format, negative currency amounts, and number of decimal places.  
  
   - Select the **Time** tab to change the time format, time separator, and notation for morning and afternoon.  
  
   - Select the **Date** tab to set the type of calendar, first day of the week, first week of the year, formats for long and short dates, and whether or not to show week numbers in [calendar view](/powerapps/user/calendar-view).  
  
7. Select **Apply** to apply the changes and continue working in the dialog box, or select **OK** to save the changes and close the dialog box.
