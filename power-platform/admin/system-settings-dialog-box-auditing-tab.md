Enable auditing to track changes to your organization's data and maintain a log of changes. 
  
## Open the System Settings dialog box

    Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. In the web app, go to **Settings** (![Settings.](media/settings-gear-icon.png "Settings")) > **Advanced Settings**.

3. Select **Settings** > **Administration**.
 
4. Select **System Settings**, and then select the **Auditing** tab.  
    
|      Setting |     Description    |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Start Auditing   | Default: Off. Start or stop auditing.    |
| Audit user access | Default: Off. If enabled, customer engagement apps (such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service) track when the user started accessing customer engagement apps and whether or not the user accessed the application by using the web application or Dynamics 365 for Outlook.  |  
| Start Read Auditing | Default: Off. Logs will be sent to the [Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance Center](https://protection.office.com/homepage). |
