# Managed Environments overview 

<!-- https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2206011 and 2211534 -->

Managed Environments is a suite of capabilities that allows admins to manage Power Platform at scale with more control, less effort, and more insights. Admins can use Managed Environments with any type of environment. [Learn how to enable Managed Environments](managed-environment-enable.md).

These are the primary elements of Managed Environments:

- [Limit sharing](managed-environment-sharing-limits.md)
- [Weekly digests](managed-environment-usage-insights.md)
- [Data policies](managed-environment-data-policies.md)

> [!NOTE]
> Managed Environments is included as an entitlement in standalone Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Virtual Agents, Power Pages, and Dynamics 365 licenses that give premium usage rights. To learn more about Managed Environment licensing, see [Licensing](managed-environment-licensing.md) and [Licensing overview for Microsoft Power Platform](pricing-billing-skus.md).
