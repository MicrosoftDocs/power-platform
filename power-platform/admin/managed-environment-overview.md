# Managed Environments overview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Managed Environments is a suite of capabilities that allows admins to manage Power Platform at scale with more control, less effort, and more insights. Admins can use Managed Environments with any type of environment. [Learn how to enable Managed Environments](managed-environment-enable.md).

There are three primary elements of Managed Environments:

- [Weekly digests](managed-environment-weekly-digests.md)
- [Sharing limits](managed-environment-sharing-limits.md)
- [Data policies](managed-environment-data-policies.md) 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - This feature is being gradually rolled out across regions and might not be available yet in your region.

## License considerations

Managed Environments adds value to your existing premium Power Platform capabilities. All applications and flows in a managed environment are premium. They can be licensed using any of the Power Platform licensing options (per user, per app or flow, or pay-as-you-go) or Dynamics 365 licenses that give premium usage rights. [Learn more about Power Platform licensing](pricing-billing-skus.md).

During the public preview, we are not enforcing the premium license requirement for applications and flows in a managed environment.

Standard environments:
