# What are preview features, and how do I enable them? 

Preview features are features that aren't complete, but are made available on a "preview" basis so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features:  
  
- Are subject to separate [Supplemental Terms of Use](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=511446).  
  
- Are not supported by [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Support](../includes/pn-microsoft-support.md)] for production use. Microsoft Support is, however, eager to get your feedback on the preview functionality, and might provide best effort support in certain cases. 
  
- May have limited or restricted functionality.  
  
- Aren't meant for production use.  
  
- May be available only in selected geographic areas.
