# What are Preview features, and how do I enable them? 

<!-- legacy procedure -->

Preview features are features that aren't complete, but are made available on a "preview" basis so customers can get early access and provide feedback. Preview features:  
  
- Are subject to separate [Supplemental Terms of Use](/dynamics365/legal/supp-dynamics365-preview).  
  
- **Are not supported by [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Support](../includes/pn-microsoft-support.md)]**.  
  
- May have limited or restricted functionality.  
  
- Aren't meant for production use.  
  
- May be available only in selected geographic areas.  
  
## How do I enable a Preview feature?  
To enable a Preview feature, you must be an administrator.
