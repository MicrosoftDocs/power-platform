Integrating [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Office_365](../includes/pn-ms-office-365.md)] with model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, is a great way to enhance your customer relationship management with the power of cloud services: easier maintenance, broader availability, and better coordination across multiple devices.
