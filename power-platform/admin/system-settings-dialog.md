# System Settings dialog box  

The **System Settings** dialog box is the legacy experience for managing environment and system-level settings for Microsoft Dataverse and Dynamics 365 customer engagement apps, such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, and Dynamics 365 Field Service.

> [!NOTE]
> We have moved the settings described in the legacy system settings dialog articles to the Power Platform admin center. More information: [Environment settings are moving](../admin/admin-settings.md#environment-settings-are-moving).
