# System Settings dialog box  

Use the **System Settings** dialog box to specify system-level settings for your environment and customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation).

> [!NOTE]
> Getting to the **System Settings** dialog box can vary based on the type of app you're using (Unified Interface or the legacy web client). You might need to adjust the procedural steps in this section to reflect your app type. See [Settings](../admin/admin-settings.md#app-settings).
>
> Also, we are moving some settings from customer engagement apps to the Power Platform admin center. See [Environment settings are moving](../admin/admin-settings.md#environment-settings-are-moving).
