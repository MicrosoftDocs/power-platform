> [!NOTE]
> - Users who try to view [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps on an unsupported browser may be redirected to a mobile experience. 
>   - For [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-9-0-0-online](../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)] and later, users are redirected to the Unified Interface experience. For more information see [Unified Interface Overview](about-unified-interface.md). 
>   - For versions earlier than [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-9-0-0-online](../includes/pn-crm-9-0-0-online.md)], users are redirected to [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-for-phones-express](../includes/pn-crm-for-phones-express.md)]. This is a basic service that has limited functionality, and isn’t intended to serve as a substitute for the full feature set of [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps. We recommend that users choose a supported browser or a [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps specific to the device. 
> -  If you have added content to forms or dashboards in an iFrame, you might have implemented security restrictions around certain actions in that content, such as external links. Keep in mind that in [!INCLUDE[tn_Firefox](../includes/tn-firefox.md)], this security restriction code will likely be unsupported.

### Limited copy and paste support in Firefox and Chrome  
 Copy and paste functionality by using the clipboard is not yet fully supported on the [!INCLUDE[tn_Firefox](../includes/tn-firefox.md)] and [!INCLUDE[tn_chrome](../includes/tn-chrome.md)] web browsers; the **Copy a Link** button at the top of the page may not function as expected.
