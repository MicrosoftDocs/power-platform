|                              **Set whether direct email through mail merge is enabled in campaigns**                              |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                                                Enable Direct Email via Mail Merge                                                 | Default: Yes. If Yes, users can send email as a campaign activity using the mail merge feature. **Note:**  To enable this option, the security role assigned to users for whom you want to enable mail merge must also include the Mail Merge privilege. |
| **Set whether campaign responses are created for incoming campaign activity email (Available only if Email tracking is enabled)** |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                                           Create campaign responses for incoming email                                            |                     Default: Yes. If Yes, customer engagement apps create campaign response records automatically when email messages are received in response to a specific marketing campaign.                     |
|                        **Set the auto-unsubscribe options (Available only if Email tracking is enabled)**                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
|                          Set "Do Not Send Marketing Material" option when unsubscribe email is received                           |                         Default: No. If Yes, when an unsubscribe email is received, the preference setting for the account, contact, or lead from the marketing list gets updated automatically to not send marketing materials.                         |
|                                      Send acknowledgement to customers when they unsubscribe                                      |                                                 If the previous setting **Set "Do Not Send Marketing Material"** is Yes, you can use this setting to send a response to customers when they unsubscribe.                                                 |
|                                                Template for Acknowledgement Email                                                 |                                                              If the two previous settings are Yes, you must specify an email template to use to respond to customers when they unsubscribe.                                                              |
