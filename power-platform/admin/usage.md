**Usage** in the Power Platform admin center is a centralized location for tracking engagement and adoption across Power Apps, Power Automate, and Copilot Studio agents. This experience is designed to spotlight high-impact resources to help organizations identify what's driving value and where to focus investment.

## Usage Insights
The **Usage** page in the Power Platform admin center helps you identify the top resources in your organization that are driving success and spot adoption trends, such as usage spikes for apps, flows, and agents. At the top of the page, you will find a summary view showcasing the adoption trends over time as well as the resources that are driving the most value:
1. **Top Apps** by user activity
2. **Top Flows** by run volume
3. **Top Agents** by session count.

Below the summary view, detailed tables provide sortable views of all apps, flows, and agents that are in use in your organization. Sort by users for apps, runs for flows, and sessions for agents to quickly identify trends and top performers.
### Power Apps
This table features usage by user activity and includes canvas apps and model-driven apps. 

### Power Automate
