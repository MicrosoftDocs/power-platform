# Set up server-side synchronization of email, appointments, contacts, and tasks

You can use server-side synchronization to synchronize your email system with Microsoft Dataverse apps at the server level. Dataverse apps could be first-party model-driven apps, like Dynamics 365 (online) apps or custom apps. For example, you can synchronize Dataverse model-driven apps with Microsoft Exchange Online (hosted email server) or Microsoft Exchange Server (on-premises). If you synchronize with Exchange Online or Exchange Server, in addition to Outlook email, you can synchronize Outlook appointments, contacts, and tasks.
  
You can also use server-side synchronization to synchronize Dataverse apps with a POP3 email server for web-hosted email like Gmail or Outlook.com. If you synchronize email with a POP3 email server, you canâ€™t synchronize appointments, contacts, and tasks, however.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Using encryption software (such as Vaultive) together with server-side synchronization is not supported.
> 
> If you use server-side sync, you won't be able to view S/MIME encrypted messages. Encrypting emails with S/MIME requires an application to use an S/MIME control which server-side sync does not support. For more information on S/MIME encryption, see [Encrypt messages by using S/MIME in Outlook Web App](https://support.office.com/article/Encrypt-messages-by-using-S-MIME-in-Outlook-Web-App-2E57E4BD-4CC2-4531-9A39-426E7C873E26). 
  
 **Synchronization scenarios**  
  
Choose one of the following scenarios to configure server-side synchronization for your organization:
  
- [Connect to Exchange Online](connect-exchange-online.md)  
  
- [Connect to Exchange Server on-premises](connect-exchange-server-on-premises.md)  
  
- [Connect to a POP3 or SMTP server](../admin/connect-to-pop3-or-smtp-servers.md)
