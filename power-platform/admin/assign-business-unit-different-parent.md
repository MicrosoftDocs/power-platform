# Assign a business unit to a different parent business

You can assign a different parent business to a business unit to accommodate changes in your business requirements. When you reassign a business unit, any child business units are also reassigned with it.  
  
1. In the Microsoft Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

2. Select **Settings** > **Users + permissions** > **Business Units**.  
  
3. Select the business unit you want to change the settings for.  
  
4. On the Actions toolbar, select **More Actions** > **Change Parent Business**.  
  
5. In the **Change Parent Business** dialog box, in the New parent business text box, type part or all of the name of the parent business you want to assign the business unit to, and then select the **Click to select a value for New parent business** icon  ![Lookup button](media/lookup-4.png "Lookup button").
  
6. Select the record for the parent business you want to assign the business unit to, and then click **OK**.
