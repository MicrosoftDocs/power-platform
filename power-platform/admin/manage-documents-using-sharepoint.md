# Manage your documents using SharePoint

Document management with SharePoint lets users manage common document types, such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and create folders to save and manage those documents in customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), that are seamlessly stored in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> The document management feature isn't supported for users with Power Apps for Microsoft 365 licenses. These users should upgrade to the appropriate licensing. More information: [Compare Office 365 for Business Plans](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/compare-more-office-365-for-business-plans) 
> 
> The document management feature is supported for SharePoint sites with classic and modern experience.

Depending on your environment, there are several customer engagement apps and SharePoint configurations possible. 

|Configuration  |More information  |
|---------|---------|
|Customer engagement apps with SharePoint Online  |  [Set up Dynamics 365 apps to use SharePoint Online](set-up-dynamics-365-online-to-use-sharepoint-online.md)    |
|Customer engagement apps with SharePoint on-premises     | [Configure server-based authentication with Dynamics 365 apps and SharePoint on-premises](configure-server-based-authentication-sharepoint-on-premises.md)        |

Administrators set up document management, specify permissions for managing tasks, and ensure that the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] site URLs are correct.
