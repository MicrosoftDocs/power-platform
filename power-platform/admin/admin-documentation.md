# Administer Microsoft Power Platform

The Power Platform admin center (<https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com>) provides a unified portal for administrators to manage environments and settings for Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Pages, and Microsoft Copilot Studio.

Power BI administrators use the Power BI admin portal (<https://app.powerbi.com>) to manage a Power BI tenant including the configuration of governance policies, usage monitoring, and provisioning of licenses, capacities, and organizational resources. Learn more about Power BI admin portal at [What is Power BI administration?](/power-bi/service-admin-administering-power-bi-in-your-organization)

The Power Platform admin center is also used by administrators of some Dynamics 365 apps, such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, and Dynamics 365 Marketing, to manage environments and settings.
