# Licensing

When Managed Environments are activated in an environment every Power App, Power Automate flow, Power Virtual Agents bot, and Power Pages website in that environment requires standalone licenses for access. For example: 

- Every user running a Power App in a Managed Environment must have a Power Apps per user or per app license 
- Every user running a Power Automate flow in a Managed Environment must have a standalone Power Automate per user license, or the flow must have a Power Automate per flow license 

To see your current license usage, select **View license consumption (preview)** in the Power Platform admin center. More information: [View license consumption (preview)](view-license-consumption-issues.md)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enabling [pay-as-you-go](pay-as-you-go-overview.md) for a managed environment will not be sufficient to meet Managed Environments licensing requirements, if:
> - There are users without standalone Power Apps licenses using Power Apps in that environment.
> - There are users without standalone Power Automate licenses using flows in that environment or users using flows without Power Automate per flow licenses in that environment or users using flows without Power Automate per flow licenses in that environment.
