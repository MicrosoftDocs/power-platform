You can enable or disable them for SLA-enabled entity records in your organization. For example, you might want to disable SLAs during maintenance activities or when you're importing records and you don't want the SLAs to apply to the records. To disable, select **Yes**. To enable, select **No**. **Note:**  When SLAs are disabled, SLA records can still be created or modified.

| Automatically apply SLA on entity record update after SLA was manually applied **Important:**  For [!INCLUDE[pn_CRM_Online](../includes/pn-crm-online.md)] apps organizations, this feature is available only if your organization has installed [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2016_update](../includes/pn-crm-online-2016-update.md)]. For on-premises Dynamics 365 for Dynamics 365 apps organizations, this feature is only available if you've updated to CRM 2016. Interested in getting this feature?

The automatic SLA application can either be through the entitlement applied to the case(for theCase entity) or with the default SLA.<br /><br /> Either way, the manual SLA takes precedence over any other way of SLA application.<br /><br /> When set to **No**, SLAs won’t be applied automatically to records after an SLA is manually applied. **Note:**  For Case entity records, when both entitlement and customer, and manual SLA are changing, the manual SLA is used regardless of this setting.                                                                                                                                                                              |
