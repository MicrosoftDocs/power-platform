# Working with the admin portals

In a perfect world as an administrator you would only visit a single portal to perform all your administrative tasks but given the scope and breadth of the different products involved and their differing release cycles, there are multiple portals with which you will interact. The following outlines the different portals and the most common tasks you perform there.


|Portal  |Common Tasks  |
|---------|---------|
|Power Platform admin center <br/>https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com     |The new unified administrative portal for Power Platform admins. Currently this portal can be used for Microsoft Dataverse environment Management, to submit Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Automate focused support tickets, and to view Power Apps and Power Automate admin analytics. The following admin experiences have now migrated and been replaced by the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/): <br/><ol><li>Power Apps Admin Portal</li> <li>Power Automate Admin Portal</li><li>Business platform admin center</li> <li>Dynamics 365 admin center</li> </ol>   |
|Power Apps admin center   | You now use the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).         |
|Power Apps maker portal <br/>https://make.powerapps.com     |This portal is focused on building Power Apps but can also view and manage Dataverse components, manage connectors and gateways. You can also see application statistics from details on apps here.         |
|Power Automate admin center<br/>https://admin.flow.microsoft.com     | You now use the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).       |
|Business platform admin center <br/>https://admin.businessplatform.microsoft.com     | You now use the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).        |
|Dynamics 365 admin center<br/>https://port.crm. dynamics.com/G/manage/index.aspx     | You now use the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).           |
|Environment Management <br/>https://port.crm<N>.dynamics.com /G/Instances/InstancePicker.aspx     | You now use the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).       |
|Microsoft 365 admin center <br/>https://admin.microsoft.com/AdminPortal     |Here you will manage users and their license assignment as well as you can launch into many of the individual admin centers from here.         |
|Microsoft Azure<br/>https://portal.azure.com     |Advanced Azure AD management tasks like conditional access is managed here. Also if you support any developer application registration it is also done here. This is also where you start setup of your on-premises gateways.         |
|Security and Compliance Center<br/>https://protection.office.com     |In addition to the general compliance tasks, administrators can come here to search the Audit log to see Power Automate audit events         |

Over the near-term future we will see consolidation of the Power Apps, Power Automate, and the Dynamics 365 administration portals into a more unified administrative portal experience.
For partners helping their customers manage their cloud services using delegated administration capabilities you will not be able to use delegated access to the Power Apps and Power Automate portals. Currently, you would need to have a user in the customer's tenant and assign that user a Power Apps plan.
