# Set up SharePoint integration

This article discusses the document management capabilities of [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_SharePoint_long](../includes/pn-ms-sharepoint-long.md)] from within a Microsoft Dataverse model-driven or customer engagement app. Apps include Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation. 

With SharePoint you can store and manage documents in the context of a record on a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)], and implement the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] infrastructure to share, manage, and collaborate efficiently. Because SharePoint stores documents on a [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)], users who aren't running the app can directly access documents on the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)]. This is provided that users have the appropriate permissions.  
  
 For document management functionality, you enable server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] integration on a site collection in [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)]. Server-based [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] provides the following benefits.  
  
- Users sign in once, and therefore don't have to sign in to both customer engagement apps and [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  
  
- No another software is required to install on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)].  
  
- [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] documents will display in lists.  
  
- Users can do [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] actions from the command bar.
