# Quickly navigate with the Microsoft 365 app launcher

<a name="BKMK_AppLauncher"></a>   
## Quickly move between apps with the app launcher  
The app launcher is built in to all Dynamics 365 and [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] apps. Use the app launcher in the upper-left corner to quickly navigate to your Dynamics 365 application of choice.
