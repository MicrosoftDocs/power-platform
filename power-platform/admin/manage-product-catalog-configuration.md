# Manage product catalog configuration

<!-- legacy procedure -->

The customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation) offer a rich, easy to configure product catalog that will help your company sell products and services with greater efficiency. A sales operations manager will be able to create the product catalog with fewer SKUs, bundle product and service, as an attractive and cost effective offering, and define up-sell and cross-sell of products. In addition, the product catalog configuration data can be migrated across systems. For example, after the product catalog configuration is fully tested on the test server, you can move the configuration data to the production environment, without having to recreate it. To migrate, you'll be using the Configuration Migration Tool: [Manage configuration data](manage-configuration-data.md).  As an administrator, you will be responsible for configuring and migrating the product catalog configuration data.  
  
## Configure product catalog  
 To configure the product catalog:  
  
1. In the web app, go to **Settings** (![Settings.](media/settings-gear-icon.png "Settings")) > **Advanced Settings**.

2. Select **Settings** > **Administration**.

3. Select **System Settings**, and then select the **Sales** tab. 
  
   In the **Sales** tab, set the appropriate values for the following settings and save the changes:

To use custom pricing, select **No** for this option. Additionally, you must register a plug-in on the `CalculatePrice` message, provided in the Web services, that contains your custom pricing code. Every time you create or change the product information in an opportunity, quote, order, or invoice, the custom code is invoked instead of the system pricing engine to calculate the prices.

The number specified in this setting comes into effect only when you publish a product or a bundle with the associated properties, and not at the time when you add the properties to a draft product family record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
  
## Migrate product catalog configuration data  
 To migrate the product catalog configuration data, use the Configuration Migration Tool. For more information on how to use the tool, see: [Manage configuration data](manage-configuration-data.md).  
  
 You must select the following entities for migrating the product catalog configuration data:  
  
-   Product  
-   Product Relationship (not a mandatory entity, needed only for relationships)  
-   Property  
-   Property Association  
-   Property Option Set Item  
-   Notes (needed,  if there are any notes for the product)  
-   Currency  
-   Price List  
-   Price List Item  
-   Unit  
-   Unit Group  
-   Territory (needed if there is a default price list configuration)  
-   Connection (needed, if there is a default price list configuration)  
-   Competitor (needed, if there are any competitors for product)  
-   Sales Literature and Sales Literature Item (needed, if there is any sales literature for product)  
-   Discount (not a mandatory entity, needed only for discounts when added to price lists)  
-   Discount List (not a mandatory entity, needed only for discounts)  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  During product catalog configuration data transfer, you may see a schema validation warning, saying that the data transfer may be inconsistent. This is because you didn't include the Entitlement entity and the Entitlement Template entity in the transfer. However, these entities are not required and you can disregard the warning. The product catalog configuration data will be migrated correctly.  
  
 Certain conditions and restrictions apply during migration:  
  
-   Only active and retired products can be exported or imported.  
    > [!NOTE]
    > Transferring bundle products isn't currently supported. 
  
-   If importing of a product record fails because of a missing dependency, the related property records are not imported. When importing the product hierarchy, if creation of a record fails because of a missing dependency, the record's child hierarchy will not be imported.  
  
-   If for exporting, you selected the product entity, without selecting other entities required for export, the product records are exported without the associated properties.  
  
-   If for exporting, you select only the property entities (Property, Property Associations and Property Option Sets), without selecting the product entity, no data is exported.  
  
-   For a product record, any new property created in the source system, will also be created in the target system, after the import.   
    For a product record, the source data will override any changes in the property that also exists in the target data, after the import.   
    For a product record, if a property exists in both systems, source and target, when the property is removed from the source system, it is not removed from the target system, after the import.
