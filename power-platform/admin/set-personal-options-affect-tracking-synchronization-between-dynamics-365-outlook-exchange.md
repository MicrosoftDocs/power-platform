# Set personal options that affect tracking and synchronization between customer engagement apps and Outlook or Exchange

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

You can use the **Set Personal Options** dialog box in customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), to set many options that affect tracking and synchronization.  
  
 To open the **Set Personal Options** dialog box:  
  
- Select the **Settings** button ![Options button](media/optionsbutton.png "Options button") in the upper-right corner of the screen, and then select **Options**.  
  
  The following table summarizes the tracking and synchronization options available in the **Set Personal Options** dialog box. The **Available** column indicates whether the option is available in customer engagement apps. This column also indicates if the option is available for [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] synchronization, server-side synchronization (also known as "[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] synchronization"), or both.
