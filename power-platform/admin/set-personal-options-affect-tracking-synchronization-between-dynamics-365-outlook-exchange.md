# Set personal options that affect tracking and synchronization between Dynamics 365 apps and Outlook or Exchange

[!INCLUDE [cc-settings-moving](../includes/cc-settings-moving.md)] 

You can use the **Set Personal Options** dialog box in [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoftcrm](../includes/pn-dynamics-crm.md)] apps to set many options that affect tracking and synchronization.  
  
 To open the **Set Personal Options** dialog box:  
  
- In [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps, click the **Settings** button ![Options button for Dynamics 365 apps](media/optionsbutton.png "Options button for Dynamics 365 apps") in the upper-right corner of the screen, and then click **Options**.  
  
  The following table summarizes the tracking and synchronization options available in the **Set Personal Options** dialog box. The **Available** column indicates whether the option is available in [!INCLUDE [pn-crm-shortest](../includes/pn-crm-shortest.md)] apps. This column also indicates if the option is available for [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] synchronization, server-side synchronization (also known as “[!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)] synchronization”), or both.
