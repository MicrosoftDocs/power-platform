# Manage email notifications to admins

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Starting December 1, 2024, only users assigned to the Dynamics 365 administrator or Power Platform administrator role in the Microsoft 365 admin center or Microsoft Entra admin center will receive email notifications. To assign a service admin role to a user, follow the instructions in [Assign a service admin role to a user](use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant.md#assign-a-service-admin-role-to-a-user).

The service team regularly sends email notifications to the System Administrators of an organization. As an admin, you can set up a list of additional recipients to receive notifications using a cmdlet. For example, you can add to the list of recipients: 
- People outside of your organization, such as your partners.  
- People or distribution lists inside your company responsible for Power Platform services.

For a complete overview of Cmdlets, see [PowerShell support for Power Apps](powerapps-powershell.md).

## Send email notifications to additional recipients 

By default, admins will receive email notifications. You can add additional recipients to the list using the [Set-AdminPowerAppCdsAdditionalNotificationEmails cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.powerapps.administration.powershell/set-adminpowerappcdsadditionalnotificationemails?view=pa-ps-latest). This will allow you to add email addresses, other than users with the System Administrator role to receive email notifications 

> [!NOTE]
> If you were added as a recipient and want to stop receiving email notifications, contact your organizations’ admin. If you’re not sure who your admin is, see: [Find your administrator or support person](/powerapps/user/find-admin). 

## Obtain a list of Additional Notification email addresses 

To view the full list of email addresses that are receiving notifications, you can use the [Get-AdminPowerAppCdsAdditionalNotificationEmails cmdlet](/powershell/module/microsoft.powerapps.administration.powershell/get-adminpowerappcdsadditionalnotificationemails?view=pa-ps-latest). This will return the list of email addresses of users who are receiving notifications.
