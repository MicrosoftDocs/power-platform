# Microsoft Power Platform settings

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

Configuring the settings for Power Platform admin center, such as the view theme, language, and password, are just a click away.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).

2. Select the **Gear** icon (![Gear icon.](media/selection-rule-gear-button.png)) in the upper-right corner of the Microsoft Power Platform site.

## Prerequisites
The [Power Platform administrator role](use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant.md#power-platform-administrator) is required to view these settings and the [Global admin role](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide) to update these settings.
