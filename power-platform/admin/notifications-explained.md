# Notifications for Business & Industry Copilot services

Microsoft regularly sends communications about service changes, maintenance, retirement, and customer action that is required. These communications primarily take the form of posts to the Microsoft 365 Service health dashboard and the Message center. Occasionally, we also use direct email communications to provide status, updates, or information about the service.

## Message center

Admins can use the [Microsoft 365 Message center](/office365/admin/manage/message-center?view=o365-worldwide) to keep track of upcoming changes, including new and changed features, planned maintenance, and other important announcements. Email notifications can be sent for Message center posts.

## Service health dashboard

The [Service health dashboard](/office365/enterprise/view-service-health) shows the health status of your Microsoft services. Learn how to open the Microsoft 365 Service health dashboard in [How do I check my online service health?](check-online-service-health.md)

Service health communications in the Microsoft 365 admin center are limited to specific admin roles. [Assign admin roles](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/assign-admin-roles?view=o365-worldwide) that have permission to view service health, and review them regularly to stay current about the latest service health information.

Sometimes, Microsoft might have to notify you about issues that are occurring in your Managed Environment, when action by an admin or user in your organization is required to fix those issues. These communications appear in the **Issues in your environment that require action** section of the **Service health** page. Learn more about this section in [Learn about Microsoft 365 monitoring](/microsoft-365/enterprise/microsoft-365-monitoring?view=o365-worldwide).

## Service health in the Power Platform admin center

In the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com), admins can view service health issues for the last 30 days from the **Service health** tab of the **Help + support** page. Learn more in [View service health](view-service-health.md).

## Email service notifications

The following table lists the services that the Business & Industry Copilot communications team sends notifications for. The table also shows the email address that is used to send notifications for each service. Be sure to check your spam folder for these messages.

| Service | Email address that notifications are sent from |
|---|---|
| Microsoft Dynamics 365 apps | `msdynamics365@microsoft.com` |
| Microsoft Dynamics 365 finance and operations apps | `msdyn365finops@microsoft.com` |
| Microsoft Power Platform | `mspowerplatform@microsoft.com` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> As of December 1, 2024, only users who are assigned to the Dynamics 365 administrator or Power Platform administrator role in the Microsoft 365 admin center or Microsoft Entra admin center receive email notifications. To assign a service admin role to a user, follow the instructions in [Assign a service admin role to a user](use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant.md#assign-a-service-admin-role-to-a-user).
