# Advanced management overview

Advanced management is the next iteration of [Managed Environments](managed-environment-overview.md) with several premium capabilities being offered in each of the centers in the new Power Platform admin center! This set of premium features being offered provide enhanced security, governance, and operations capabilities for environments that have opted in for the capabilities. Advanced management is designed to offer advanced protection, greater visibility, and operational excellence, making it easier for administrators to manage their environments at scale while providing them the peace of mind and granular control across every environment covered by this feature set.
