# Use the Power Platform Environment Settings app

The Power Platform Environment Settings app provides a modern, performant, accessible, secure, and extensible management experience. This app is now generally available to the public, replacing the legacy Advanced Settings experience to provide unified experience for system administrators to create and manage their organization-wide settings.  

Any existing extensions that have been created by system administrators to extend the Advanced settings site map are preserved and shown in the new Power Platform Environment Settings app. 

Existing links for Advanced Settings from various locations in Power Platform are redirected to the new Power Platform Environment Settings app.
