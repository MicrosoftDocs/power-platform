# Manage your customer-managed encryption key

Customers have data privacy and compliance requirements to secure their data by encrypting their data at-rest. This secures the data from exposure in an event where a copy of the database is stolen. With data encryption at-rest, the stolen database data is protected from being restored to a different server without the encryption key.

All customer data stored in Power Platform is encrypted at-rest with strong Microsoft-managed encryption keys by default. Microsoft stores and manages the database encryption key for all your data so you don't have to. However, Power Platform provides this customer-managed encryption key (CMK) for your added data protection control where you can self-manage the database encryption key that is associated with your Microsoft Dataverse environment. This allows you to rotate or swap the encryption key on demand, and also allows you to prevent Microsoft's access to your customer data when you revoke the key access to our services at any time.

To learn more about customer managed key in Power Platform, watch the customer-managed key video.<p/>
> [!VIDEO https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RW14O4G]

These encryption key operations are available with customer-managed key (CMK):

- Create a RSA (RSA-HSM) key from your Azure Key vault.
- Create a Power Platform enterprise policy for your key.
- Grant the Power Platform enterprise policy permission to access your key vault.
- Grant the Power Platform service admin to read the enterprise policy.
- Apply encryption key to your environment.
- Revert/remove environment’s CMK encryption to Microsoft-managed key.
- Change key by creating a new enterprise policy, removing the environment from CMK and re-apply CMK with new enterprise policy.
- Lock CMK environments by revoking CMK key vault and/or key permissions.
- Migrate [bring-your-own-key (BYOK)](cmk-migrate-from-byok.md) environments to CMK by applying CMK key.

Currently, all your customer data stored *only* in the following apps and services can be encrypted with customer-managed key:

- Dataverse (Custom solutions and Microsoft services)
- [Power Automate](/power-automate/customer-managed-keys) <sup>1</sup>
- Chat for Dynamics 365
- [Dynamics 365 Sales](/dynamics365/sales/sales-gdpr-faqs#can-the-dynamics-365-sales-data-be-encrypted-using-customer-managed-encryption-key-cmk)
- Dynamics 365 Customer Service
- [Dynamics 365 Customer Insights - Data](/dynamics365/customer-insights/data/overview)
- Dynamics 365 Field Service
- Dynamics 365 Retail
- Dynamics 365 Finance (Finance and operations)
- Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management (Finance and operations)
- Dynamics 365 Project Operations (Finance and operations)
- Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management (Finance and operations)
- Dynamics 365 Fraud Protection (Finance and operations)

<sup>1</sup> When you apply the customer managed key to an environment that has existing Power Automate flows, the flows data continues to be encrypted with Microsoft-managed key. More information: [Power Automate customer manged key](/power-automate/customer-managed-keys).

> [!Note]
> Nuance Conversational IVR is excluded from customer-managed key encryption.

[Power Apps](/power-apps/powerapps-overview) and [Power Virtual Agent](/power-virtual-agents/fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents) store its data in their own storage and in [Microsoft Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro). When you apply the customer-managed key to these environments, only the data stores in **Microsoft Dataverse** are encrypted with your key. The non-Microsoft Dataverse data, including Power Apps source code and canvas apps icons, continue to be encrypted with the Microsoft-managed key.

> [!NOTE]
>
> The connection settings for connectors will continue to be encrypted with a Microsoft-managed key.
>
> Contact a representative for services not listed above for information about customer-managed key support.

Environments with finance and operations apps where [Power Platform integration is enabled](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/power-platform/enable-power-platform-integration) can also be encrypted. Finance and operations environments without Power Platform integration will continue to use the default Microsoft managed key to encrypt data. More information: [Encryption in finance and operations apps](/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/sysadmin/customer-managed-keys)

## Introduction to customer-managed key

With customer-managed key, administrators can provide their own encryption key from their own Azure Key Vault to the Power Platform storage services to encrypt their customer data. Microsoft doesn't have direct access to your Azure Key Vault. For Power Platform services to access the encryption key from your Azure Key Vault, the administrator creates a Power Platform enterprise policy, which references the encryption key and grants this enterprise policy access to read the key from your Azure Key Vault.

The Power Platform service administrator can then add Dataverse environments to the enterprise policy to start encrypting all the customer data in the environment with your encryption key. Administrators can change the environment's encryption key by creating another enterprise policy and add the environment (after removing it) to the new enterprise policy. In the event that the environment no longer needs to be encrypted using your customer-managed key, the administrator can remove the Dataverse environment from the enterprise policy to revert the data encryption back to Microsoft-managed key.

The administrator can lock the customer-managed key environments by revoking key access from the enterprise policy and unlock the environments by restoring the key access. More information: [Lock environments by revoking key vault and/or key permission access](cmk-lock-unlock.md)

To simplify the key management tasks, the tasks are broken down into three main areas:

1. Create encryption key.
1. Create enterprise policy and grant access.
1. Manage environment's encryption.

> [!WARNING]
> When environments are locked, they can't be accessed by anyone, including Microsoft support. Environments that are locked become disabled and data loss can occur.

## Licensing requirements for customer managed key

Customer managed key policy is only enforced on environments that are activated for Managed Environments. Managed Environments are included as an entitlement in standalone Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Virtual Agents, Power Pages, and Dynamics 365 licenses that give premium usage rights. Learn more about [Managed Environment licensing](managed-environment-licensing.md), with the [Licensing overview for Microsoft Power Platform](pricing-billing-skus.md).

In addition, access to using customer managed key for Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 requires users in the environments where the encryption key policy is enforced to have one of these subscriptions:

- Microsoft 365 or Office 365 A5/E5/G5
- Microsoft 365 A5/E5/F5/G5 Compliance
- Microsoft 365 F5 Security & Compliance
- Microsoft 365 A5/E5/F5/G5 Information Protection and Governance
- Microsoft 365 A5/E5/F5/G5 Insider Risk Management

[Learn more about these licenses](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2214240)

## Understand the potential risk when you manage your key

As with any business critical application, personnel within your organization who have administrative-level access must be trusted. Before you use the key management feature, you should understand the risk when you manage your database encryption keys. It's conceivable that a malicious administrator (a person who is granted or has gained administrator-level access with intent to harm an organization's security or business processes) working within your organization might use the manage keys feature to create a key and use it to lock your environments in the tenant.

Consider the following sequence of events.

The malicious key vault administrator creates a key and an enterprise policy on the Azure portal. The Azure Key Vault administrator goes to Power Platform admin center, and add environments to the enterprise policy. The malicious administrator then returns to the Azure portal and revokes key access to the enterprise policy thus locking all the environments. This causes business interruptions as all the environments become inaccessible, and if this event isn't resolved, that is, the key access restored, the environment data can be potentially lost.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - Azure Key Vault has built-in safeguards that assist in restoring the key, which require the **Soft Delete** and **Purge protection** key vault settings enabled.
> - Another safeguard to be considered is to make sure that there is separation of tasks where the Azure Key Vault administrator isn't granted access to the Power Platform admin center.

### Separation of duty to mitigate the risk

This section describes the customer-managed key feature duties that each admin role is responsible for. Separating these tasks helps mitigate the risk involved with customer-managed keys.

#### Azure Key Vault and Power Platform/Dynamics 365 service admin tasks

To enable customer-managed keys, first the key vault administrator creates a key in the Azure key vault and creates a Power Platform enterprise policy. When the enterprise policy is created, a special Microsoft Entra ID managed identity is created. Next, the key vault administrator returns to the Azure key vault and grants the enterprise policy/managed identity access to the encryption key.

The key vault administrator then grants the respective Power Platform/Dynamics 365 service admin read access to the enterprise policy. Once read permission is granted, the Power Platform/Dynamics 365 service admin can go to the Power Platform Admin Center and add environments to the enterprise policy. All added environments customer data is then encrypted with the customer-managed key linked to this enterprise policy.

##### Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription that includes Azure Key Vault or Azure Key Vault managed hardware security modules (preview).
- Global tenant admin or an  Microsoft Entra ID with contributor permission to the Microsoft Entra subscription and permission to create an Azure Key Vault and key. This is required to set up the key vault.

##### Create the key and grant access using Azure Key Vault

The Azure Key Vault administrator performs these tasks in Azure.

1. Create an Azure paid subscription and Key Vault. Ignore this step if you already have a subscription that includes Azure Key Vault.
1. Go to the Azure Key Vault service, and create a key. More information: [Create a key in the key vault](#create-a-key-in-the-key-vault)
1. Enable the Power Platform enterprise policies service for your Azure subscription. Do this only once. More information: [Enable the Power Platform enterprise policies service for your Azure subscription](#enable-the-power-platform-enterprise-policies-service-for-your-azure-subscription)
1. Create a Power Platform enterprise policy. More information: [Create enterprise policy](#create-enterprise-policy)
1. Grant enterprise policy permissions to access the key vault. More information: [Grant enterprise policy permissions to access key vault](#grant-enterprise-policy-permissions-to-access-key-vault)
1. Grant Power Platform and Dynamics 365 administrators permission to read the enterprise policy. More information: [Grant the Power Platform admin privilege to read enterprise policy](#grant-the-power-platform-admin-privilege-to-read-enterprise-policy)

#### Power Platform/Dynamics 365 service admin Power Platform admin center tasks

##### Prerequisite

- Power Platform administrator must be assigned to either the Power Platform or Dynamics 365 Service administrator Microsoft Entra role.

##### Manage environment's encryption in Power Platform admin center

The Power Platform administrator manages customer-managed key tasks related to the environment in Power Platform admin center.

1. Add the Power Platform environments to the enterprise policy to encrypt data with the customer-managed key. More information: [Add an environment to the enterprise policy to encrypt data](#add-an-environment-to-the-enterprise-policy-to-encrypt-data)
1. Remove environments from enterprise policy to return encryption to Microsoft managed key. More information: [Remove environments from policy to return to Microsoft managed key](#remove-environments-from-policy-to-return-to-microsoft-managed-key)
1. Change the key by removing environments from the old enterprise policy and adding environments to a new enterprise policy. More information: [Create encryption key and grant access](#change-the-environments-encryption-key-with-a-new-enterprise-policy-and-key)
1. Migrate from BYOK. If you are using the earlier self-managed encryption key feature, you can migrate your key to customer managed key. More information: [Migrate bring-your-own-key environments to customer-managed key](cmk-migrate-from-byok.md)

## Create encryption key and grant access

### Create an Azure paid subscription and key vault

In Azure, perform the following steps:

1. Create a Pay-as-you-go or its equivalent Azure subscription. This step isn't needed if the tenant already has a subscription.
1. Create a resource group. More information: [Create resource groups](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal#create-resource-groups)
1. Create a key vault using the paid subscription that includes soft-delete and purge protection with the resource group you created in the previous step.
   > [!IMPORTANT]
   >
   > - To ensure that your environment is protected from accidental deletion of the encryption key, the key vault must have soft-delete and purge protection enabled. You won’t be able to encrypt your environment with your own key without enabling these settings. More information: [Azure Key Vault soft-delete overview](/azure/key-vault/general/soft-delete-overview) More information: [Create a key vault using Azure portal](/azure/key-vault/general/quick-create-portal)

  - **keyName**: Go to **Key vaults** > select your key vault > **Keys**. Notice the key **Name** and type the name into your JSON template.
  
### Grant enterprise policy permissions to access key vault

Once the enterprise policy is created, the key vault administrator grants the enterprise policy’s managed identity access to the encryption key.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) and go to **Key vaults**.
1. Select the key vault where the key was assigned to the enterprise policy.
1. Select the **Access control (IAM)** tab, and then select **+ Add**.
1. Select **Add role assignment** from the drop-down list,
1. Search **Key Vault Crypto Service Encryption User** and select it.
1. Select **Next**.
1. Select **+ Select members**.
1. Search for the enterprise policy you have created.
1. Select the enterprise policy, and then choose **Select**.
1. Select **Review + assign**.

> [!NOTE]
> The above permission setting is based on your key vault's **Permission model** of **Azure role-based access control**. If your key vault is set to **Vault access policy**, it's recommended that you migrate to the role-based model. To grant your enterprise policy access to the key vault using **Vault access policy**, create an Access policy, select **Get** on *Key management operations* and **Unwrap key** and **Wrap key** on *Cryptographic Operations*.



### Grant the Power Platform admin privilege to read enterprise policy

Administrators who have Azure global, Dynamics 365, and Power Platform administration roles can access the Power Platform admin center to assign environments to the enterprise policy. To access the enterprise policies, the global admin with Azure key vault access is required to grant the **Reader** role to the Power Platform admin. Once the **Reader** role is granted, the Power Platform administrator will be able to view the enterprise policies on the Power Platform admin center.  

> [!NOTE]
> Only Power Platform and Dynamics 365 administrators who are granted the reader role to the enterprise policy can add an environment to the policy. Other Power Platform or Dynamics 365 administrators might be able to view the enterprise policy but they'll get an error when they try to **Add environment** to the policy.

### Grant reader role to a Power Platform administrator

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/).
1. Copy the Power Platform or Dynamics 365 admin’s object ID. To do this:
   1. Go to the **Users** area in Azure.
   1. In the **All users** list, find the user with Power Platform or Dynamics 365 admin permissions using **Search users**.
   1. Open the user record, on the **Overview** tab copy the user’s **Object ID**. Paste this into a text editor such as NotePad for later.
1. Copy the enterprise policy resource ID. To do this:
   1. Go to **Resource Graph Explorer** in Azure.
   1. Enter `microsoft.powerplatform/enterprisepolicies` in the **Search** box, and then select the **microsoft.powerplatform/enterprisepolicies** resource.
   1. Select **Run query** on the command bar. A list of all the Power Platform enterprise policies is displayed.
   1. Locate the enterprise policy where you want to grant access.
   1. Scroll to the right of the enterprise policy and select **See details**.
   1. On the **Details** page, copy the **id**.
1. Start [Azure Cloud Shell](https://azure.microsoft.com/get-started/azure-portal/cloud-shell/#features), and run the following command replacing *objId* with the user’s object ID and *EP Resource Id* with the `enterprisepolicies` ID copied in the previous steps:
    `New-AzRoleAssignment -ObjectId { objId} -RoleDefinitionName Reader -Scope {EP Resource Id}`

## Manage environment's encryption

To manage the environment's encryption, you need the following permission:

- Microsoft Entra active user who has a Power Platform and/or Dynamics 365 admin security role.
- Microsoft Entra user who has either a global tenant admin, Power Platform or Dynamics 365 service admin role.

The key vault admin notifies the Power Platform admin that an encryption key and an enterprise policy were created and provides the enterprise policy to the Power Platform admin. To enable the customer-managed key, the Power Platform admin assigns their environments to the enterprise policy. Once the environment is assigned and saved, Dataverse initiates the encryption process to set all the environment data, and encrypt it with the customer-managed key.

### Enable Managed environment to be added to the enterprise policy

1. Sign into the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com), and locate the environment.
1. Select and check the environment on the environments list.
1. Select the **Enable Managed Environments** icon on the action bar.
1. Select **Enable**.

### Add an environment to the enterprise policy to encrypt data

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The environment will be disabled when it is added to the enterprise policy for data encryption.

1. Sign into the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com), and go to **Policies** > **Enterprise policies**.
1. Select a policy, and then on the command bar select **Edit**.
1. Select **Add environments**, select the environment you want, and then select **Continue**.
   :::image type="content" source="media/cmk-add-environments-enterprise-policy.png" alt-text="Add environment to enterprise policy on Power Platform admin center":::
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Confirm**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Only environments that are in the same region as the enterprise policy are displayed in the **Add environments** list.
> - The encryption can take up to four days to complete, but the environment might be enabled before the **Add environments** operation completes.
> - The operation might not complete and if it fails, your data continues to be encrypted with Microsoft managed key. You can re-run the **Add environments** operation again.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only add environments that are enabled as Managed Environments. Trial and Teams environment types can't be added to the enterprise policy.

### Remove environments from policy to return to Microsoft managed key

Follow these steps if you want to return to a Microsoft managed encryption key.

You may delete and remove the enterprise policy's permissions after 30 days.

### Change the environment's encryption key with a new enterprise policy and key

To rotate your encryption key, create a new key and a new enterprise policy. You can then change the enterprise policy by removing the environments and then adding the environments to the new enterprise policy.
 > [!NOTE]
   > Using **New key version** and setting **Rotation policy** to rotate your encryption key is now supported.

1. In [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/), create a new key and a new enterprise policy. More information:  [Create encryption key and grant access](#create-encryption-key-and-grant-access) and [Create an enterprise policy](#create-enterprise-policy)
1. Once the new key and enterprise policy are created, go to **Policies** > **Enterprise policies**.
1. Select the **Environment with policies** tab, and then find the environment you want to remove from customer-managed key.
1. Select the **All policies** tab, select the environment you verified in step 2, and then select **Edit policy** on the command bar.
   :::image type="content" source="media/cmk-ppac-remove-env-policy.png" alt-text="Remove an environment from customer-managed key":::
1. Select **Remove environment** on the command bar, select the environment you want to remove, and then select **Continue**.
1. Select **Save**.
1. Repeat steps 2-6 until all environments in the enterprise policy have been removed.

  > The environment will be disabled when it is removed from the enterprise policy to revert the data encryption to the Microsoft-managed key. **Do not delete or disable the key, delete or disable the key vault, or remove the enteprise policy's permissions to the key vault**. The key and key vault's access is necessary to support database restoration. You may delete and remove the enterprise policy's permissions after 30 days.

1. Once all the environments are removed, from the Power Platform admin center go to **Enterprise policies**.
1. Select the new enterprise policy, and then select **Edit policy**.
1. Select **Add environment**, select the environments that you want to add, and then select **Continue**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The environment will be disabled when it's added to the new enterprise policy. 

### Change the environment's encryption key with a new key version
You can change the environment’s encryption key by creating a new key version. When you create a new key version, the new key version is automatically enabled. All the storage resources detect the new key version and start applying it to encrypt your data. 

When you modify the key or the key version, the protection of the root encryption key changes, but the data in the storage always remains encrypted with your key. There is no additional action required on your part to ensure that your data is protected. Rotating the key version doesn't impact performance. There is no downtime associated with rotating the key version. It can take 24 hours for all the resource providers to apply the new key version in the background. The previous key version **must not be disabled** as it's required for the service to use it for the re-encryption and for the support of database restoration. 

To rotate the encryption key by creating a new key version, use the following steps.

1.	Go to the [Azure portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/) > **Key Vaults** and locate the key vault where you want to create a new key version.
1.	Navigate to **Keys**.
1. Select the current, enabled key.
1.	Select **+ New Version**.
1.	Note that the **Enabled** setting defaults to **Yes**, which means that the new key version is automatically enabled upon creation.
1.	Select **Create**.

You can also rotate the encryption key using the [Rotation policy](/azure/key-vault/keys/how-to-configure-key-rotation#key-rotation-policy) by either configuring a rotation policy or rotate, on demand, by invoking [Rotate now](/azure/key-vault/keys/how-to-configure-key-rotation#rotation-on-demand).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The new key version is automatically rotated in the background and there is no action required by the Power Platform admin. It is important that the previous key version must not be disabled or deleted for, at least, 28 days to support database restoration. Disabling or deleting the previous key version too early can take your environment offline.

### View the list of encrypted environments

1. Sign into the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com), and go to **Policies** > **Enterprise policies**.
1. On the **Enterprise policies** page, select the **Environments with policies** tab. The list of environments that were added to enterprise policies are displayed.

> [!NOTE]
> There might be situations where the **Environment status** or the **Encryption status** show a **Failed** status. When this occurs, submit a Microsoft Support request for help.

## Environment database operations

A customer tenant can have environments that are encrypted using the Microsoft managed key and environments that are encrypted with the customer managed key. To maintain data integrity and data protection, the following controls are available when managing environment database operations.

- [Restore](backup-restore-environments.md) 
   The environment to overwrite (the restored to environment) is restricted to the same environment that the backup was taken from or to another environment that is encrypted with the same customer managed key. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Restore backup.](media/cmk-restore-backup.png "Restore backup")

- [Copy](copy-environment.md)
   The environment to overwrite (the copied to environment) is restricted to another environment that is encrypted with the same customer managed key. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Copy environment.](media/cmk-copy-environment.png "Copy environment")

   > [!NOTE]
   > If a Support Investigation environment was created to resolve support issue in a customer managed environment, the encryption key for the Support Investigation environment must be changed to customer managed key before the Copy environment operation can be performed. 

- [Reset](sandbox-environments.md#reset-a-sandbox-environment)
   The environment's encrypted data will be deleted including backups. After the environment is reset, the environment encryption will revert back to the Microsoft managed key.
