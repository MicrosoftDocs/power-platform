# Manage PrincipalObjectAccess storage

Users in an environment with the Microsoft Dataverse database can collaborate with other users by granting access to a user-owned record. The user can share a record with another user or team, or reassign a record to another user or team.

To manage this record-level collaboration and to provide user access to shared records, all sharing of records and their permissions are stored in the PrincipalObjectAccess (POA) table. Whenever users try to access a record that they don’t own or don't have the appropriate privilege in their security role, the system checks the POA table to authorize the user’s access. 

## Sources of POA

### Share reassigned records with original owner

When this setting is set to **Yes**, then record would be created in the POA table whenever a user assigns a record to another user or team. The original owner is automatically added as **Share** to.

### Access teams
When an access team is used for record collaboration, records are created in the POA table whenever a user is added to the access team. There are two types of access teams:

- **System-managed**: These are created via templates and are embedded on a form to allow the user to easily manage the member list. The system automatically creates an access team for a record that is shared. For example, Account #1 has an access team that is different from Account #2. 

- **Manually added**: These are individual access teams where an admin/owner of the team manages the team members list. 

### Direct sharing

- When a user explicitly shares a record to another user, a record is created in the POA table.

- Direct sharing also occurs with a record that has a cascade sharing relationship or on a table with a parent/child relationship. When a parent record is shared to a user or team, the shared-to user or team has access to all the cascaded or child records. All these permissions to access the child records are created in the POA table. 

  **Example of table relationship**
  
  A table can be set to have relationships with other tables (for example, Account to Case). By default, the relationship of the **Reparent** option is set to **Cascade All**. All related subrecords are shared to the owner of the parent record.  

  For example: User #1 owns Account #1. User #1 shares Account #1 with User #2. User #2 creates a Case #1 underneath Account #1. With the out-of-the-box reparent options, User #1 has access to Case #1. All these user permissions are captured in the POA table.

### Indirect sharing
When a user shares a record to a team, all members of the team are indirectly shared to.  

### Sharing source
The RetrieveAccessOrigin API can be used to determine where a user or team’s access to a specific table comes from. The API requires an objectId, logicalName, and principalId in the request, and the response is a string describing where the access to the table was obtained.

## Management of POA table growth  

- Evaluate your business needs and turn on **Set whether reassigned records are shared with the original owner** where needed. Note that this is a system-wide setting. Once it’s turned on, the setting is applied to all records.
- Share with users for collaboration where the list of users isn't the same in the different records you shared.
- Use the team as the record owner if you frequently share records with the same list of users or share the record with the team.
- If you have a complex business unit structure and frequent use of sharing:
  - Share only where needed.
  - Minimize the number of business units.
  - Make sure that users are placed in the appropriate business unit.
  - Share to the team to allow users from different business units to access records.
- When a record can be accessed by multiple access teams—for example, a sales representative team that can only read the record, and another sales manager team that has full read and write access—consider using different role-based forms for sales representative and sales manager. 
- Manage the lifecycle of your access team members. Remove users who are no longer needed for the collaboration.
- Remove all access team members when collaboration is over.
