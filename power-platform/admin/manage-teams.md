# Dataverse teams management

Using teams is optional. However, teams provide an easy way to share business objects and let you collaborate with other people across business units. While a team belongs to one business unit, it can include users from other business units. You can associate a user with more than one team. This topic discusses the different types of teams and their various operations.

## Types of teams

**Owner team:** An owner team owns records and has security roles assigned to the team.  A user's privileges can come from their individual security roles, those of the team(s) they are part of, and/or the ones they inherit. A team has full access rights on the records that the team owns.  Team members are added manually to the owner team. 

**Access team:** An access team doesn't own records and doesn't have security roles assigned to the team. The team members have privileges defined by their individual security roles and by roles from the teams for which they are members. They share records with an access team, and the team is granted access rights to the records. Access rights include Read, Write, and Append.

**Azure AD group team:** Similar to owner teams, an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) group team can own records and can have security roles assigned to the team. *Security* and *Office* are two group team types, and they correspond directly to Azure AD group types. Group security roles can be only for a specific team or for a team member with user privileges that include [members' privilege inheritance](security-roles-privileges.md#team-members-privilege-inheritance). Team members are dynamically derived (added and removed) when they access an environment based on their Azure AD group membership. See [Manage group teams](manage-group-teams.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can assign security role to **Owner and Azure AD group teams** and the user directly. The Environment picker only recognizes users who are member of Azure AD group teams and users who have security role assigned to them directly.
