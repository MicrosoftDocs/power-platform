# View Power Platform administrative logs using auditing solutions in Microsoft Purview

Administration of Power Platform products and services can affect various capabilities such as environment settings and operations, data policies, and integration-related settings. It's important to audit such actions that help mitigate failures, help contain systems of security constraints, adhere to compliance requirements, and act on security threats.

In this article, you learn about activities that are performed on Power Platform environments by those having administrative access across user experiences and programmable interfaces using Microsoft Purview compliance portal. The activities fall within the following categories:

- [Environment lifecycle operations](#activity-category-environment-lifecycle-operations)
- [Environment property and setting change activities](#activity-category-environment-property-and-setting-change-activities)

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Administrative activities for Power Platform environments are enabled by default on all tenants. You can't disable activity collection.
> - At least one user with an assigned Microsoft 365 E5 or greater license, as required by Microsoft Purview. More information: [Auditing solutions in Microsoft Purview](/purview/audit-solutions-overview)

The audit activities include actions made by Power Platform administrators, Dynamics 365 administrators, members of the System Administrator role (for Power Platform environments with Dataverse), the environment creator or owner (for Power Platform environments without Dataverse), and impersonated users that map to any of these roles.

Each activity event consists of a common schema defined at [Office 365 Management Activity API schema](/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema#auditlogrecordtype). The schema defines the payload of metadata that is unique for each activity.

## Activity category: Environment lifecycle operations

Each activity event contains a payload of metadata that is specific to the individual event. The following _environment lifecycle operation_ activities are delivered to Microsoft Purview.

## View activities in Microsoft Purview

When audit log search is turned on in the Microsoft Purview compliance portal, admin activity from your organization is recorded in the Microsoft Purview audit log.

You can use several methods to search events in Microsoft Purview.

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-activity-logging/audit-search.png" alt-text="Microsoft Purview search audit page":::

Use wild card search for contextual information in the Microsoft Purview user experience.

Narrow down search constructs that are specific to individual events.

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-activity-logging/filter-record-types.png" alt-text="Filter record types in Microsoft Purview audit search":::

As you search, individual activities are shown. A common schema is enforced to enable search constructs across activities. The value in the **PropertyCollection** field is specific to each activity type.

For more information about the Microsoft Purview audit log, data retention policies, and capabilities, see [Auditing solutions in Microsoft Purview](/purview/audit-solutions-overview).
