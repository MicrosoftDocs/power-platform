# View Power Platform administrative logs using auditing solutions in Microsoft Purview (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Administration of Power Platform products and services can affect various capabilities such as environment settings and operations, data policies, and integration-related settings. It's important to audit such actions that help mitigate failures, help contain systems of security constraints, adhere to compliance requirements, and act on security threats.

In this article, you learn about activities that are performed on Power Platform environments by those having administrative access across user experiences and programmable interfaces using Microsoft Purview compliance portal. The activities fall within the following categories:

- [Environment lifecycle operations](#activity-category-environment-lifecycle-operations)
- [Environment property and setting change activities](#activity-category-environment-property-and-setting-change-activities)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features arenâ€™t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - Administrative activities for Power Platform environments are enabled by default on all tenants. You can't disable activity collection.
> - At least one user with an assigned Microsoft 365 E5 or greater license, as required by Microsoft Purview. More information: [Auditing solutions in Microsoft Purview](/purview/audit-solutions-overview)

The audit activities include actions made by global administrators, Power Platform administrators, Dynamics 365 administrators, members of the System Administrator role (for Power Platform environments with Dataverse), the environment creator or owner (for Power Platform environments without Dataverse), and impersonated users that map to any of these roles.

Each activity event consists of a common schema defined at [Office 365 Management Activity API schema](/en-us/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-schema#auditlogrecordtype). The schema defines the payload of metadata that is unique for each activity.

## Activity category: Environment lifecycle operations

Each activity event contains a payload of metadata that is specific to the individual event. The following _environment lifecycle operation_ activities are delivered to Microsoft Purview.
