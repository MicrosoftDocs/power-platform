## Implement Virtual Network support

Power Platform infrastructure consists of a serverless container orchestration layer that executes different workloads with a strict security boundary and guarantees individual, workload-level availability and scalability requirements. This container orchestration layer is used for all workloads needing isolation, including internal, Microsoft workload-like connectors and customer workloads, like plugins.

The containerized workload allows Power Platform to support network-level isolation, using a combination of Azure Subnet Delegation and Virtual Network injection features. The Virtual Network *injection* feature allows a container to get injected into a customer’s Virtual Network by attaching a network interface card (NIC). Any workload, running on that configured container, is executed within the customer’s network and can use private IP addresses within the network. For a plugin workload, the plugin code can access user services, resources, or Azure resources with a private link exposed to the same Virtual Network. Similarly, a connector workload can access the target resource or endpoint inside the same Virtual Network.

### Azure subnet delegation

Virtual Network support for Power Platform relies on [Azure subnet delegation](/azure/virtual-network/subnet-delegation-overview). Enterprises delegate a subnet to Power Platform, used by Power Platform services such as Dataverse plugins and connectors such as [custom connectors](/connectors/custom-connectors/), SQL, and Azure file storage to process requests at runtime. Windows containers use the IP address from the delegated subnet to handle these requests.

Since the container operates within the boundaries of the delegated subnet and uses its IP address, any outbound call from this container remains within the enterprise's network boundaries. For example, the call stays within the Virtual Network that's part of this subnet. This setup allows enterprises to have full control over the policies, rules, and network packets that exit for these Windows containers. Enterprises can apply the same controls to the delegated subnet as they do with their own network.

Power Platform doesn't manage the configuration of the delegated subnet. The only requirement is that the delegated subnet must not be associated with any other service. Once a subnet is delegated, the IPs within that subnet are reserved only for Power Platform. The subnet can't be used for any other resources or delegated to other services.

By default, internet access is turned off from Windows containers. If the enterprise's code running within these containers has a requirement for internet access, they can configure [NAT Gateway](/azure/nat-gateway/nat-overview) on the delegated subnet to allow the Windows containers to connect to resources on the internet.

#### Delegated subnet ownership for Microsoft and customers

| Controls | Description | Ownership lies with |
|----------|-------------|---------------------|
| NAT Gateway | When a NAT Gateway is attached to a subnet, it becomes the next hop for all internet-destined traffic from that subnet. Any outbound traffic from the subnet to the internet is routed through the NAT Gateway. All instances within the subnet remain private with secure and scalable outbound connectivity. | Customer |
| Network Security Groups (NSGs) | Customers can associate NSGs with the delegated subnet. Define and enforce security rules to control inbound and outbound traffic to and from the subnet. | Customer |
| Route tables | Customers can associate route tables with the delegated subnet. Define custom routing policies to control the flow of traffic within the Virtual Network and to external networks. | Customer |
| Network monitoring | Network monitoring helps in maintaining compliance with security policies by enforcing traffic to travel through the enterprise's virtual private network. | Customer|
| IP address management | Customers can dictate the IP address space for the delegated subnet, ensuring it uses private IP address ranges, for example **10.0.0.0/8**, **192.168.0.0/16**, **172.16.0.0/12**. | Customer |
| DNS configuration | Customers can configure custom DNS settings for the delegated subnet, including Azure DNS entries. | Customer |
| Windows container | Windows containers execute requests from Virtual Network-supported services and acquire IPs from the delegated subnet. | Microsoft |
| Multitenant support  | All customer requests are executed in their own delegated subnet. | Microsoft |

## Technical architecture

The layout and communication flow of components demonstrates *using* versus *not using* the Virtual Network feature for plugin and connector workloads:

:::image type="content" source="media/technical-architecture.png" alt-text="Virtual network technical architecture" lightbox="media/technical-architecture.png":::

In a Virtual Network configuration, the container running the plugin or connector is part of a customer’s Virtual Network. Communications to endpoints within the Virtual Network remain within the Virtual Network boundary. Customers can extend the boundary to other virtual or on-premises networks by using Virtual Network peering and ExpressRoute or VPN Gateways.

Power Platform components in a containerized workload of a customer’s Virtual Network must have some communication with the components in the workload. For example, Power Platform can trigger a plugin in the workload or invoke the connector when needed.

Since the container isn't attached to the infrastructure network, a special channel is established with the container from the orchestration layer. This channel allows specific signals to be sent to the workload. A local IP within the container (APIPA address) is used for this purpose. Only specific inbound messages to the workload from the platform are allowed to maintain the isolation of the container and the workload.

The following diagram shows how Power Platform can route execution requests to the container while maintaining the container-isolation boundaries:

### Set-up and configuration considerations

To use the Virtual Network support for Power Platform, consider the following guidelines when you set up and configure it.

#### Regional

Virtual Network support requires that a Power Platform environment location must match the delegated, subnets Azure regions. If you have a Power Platform environment in the United States, then each of two Virtual Networks and subnets must be in the East US and West US Azure regions.

If your Azure resources are in different regions, use a global, Virtual Network peering or a similar connectivity option with high speed and low latency. With Microsoft Backbone, establish the connectivity between the Power Platform Virtual Network and enterprises Virtual Network.

#### Subnet size

The size of the delegated subnet within a Virtual Network is a critical concern, considering future growth in usage and the onboarding of new services. The following table provides guidance on the number of environments that can be attached to the same enterprise policy based on available IPs. Size ensures that requests aren't throttled.

  | Minimum number of environments | Maximum number of environments | Virtual Network execution load  | Subnet size |
  |----------|------------|--------------|-------------|
  | 3 | 5 | High to high | `/24` <br>251 usable IP addresses |
  | 10 | 20 | High to medium | `/24` <br>251 usable IP addresses |
  | 20 | 50 | Medium to low | `/24` <br>251 usable IP addresses |
  
**High execution load**: This is typically characterized by a high volume of requests in an environment. For instance, if you anticipate many plug-ins, flows, or apps executing within a single environment on a Virtual Network, you should plan for a high execution load. In this case, you might allocate 3-5 environments per subnet with a /24 subnet size, which provides 251 usable IP addresses.

**Medium execution load**: This category is suitable for scenarios where the volume of requests is moderate. If you expect a balanced load that isn't as intense as the high execution load, but still requires substantial resources, you can plan for 10-20 environments per subnet with the same /24 subnet size.

**Low execution load**: This is ideal for environments with a lower volume of requests. If the usage is expected to be light, you can allocate 20-50 environments per subnet with a /24 subnet size.

It's important to consider future growth and the onboarding of new services when categorizing the Power Plaform environments. Ensuring that your subnets have enough IP addresses to accommodate the expected load helps prevent throttling and maintains performance. If you find that the /24 subnet size isn't sufficient in the future, you should plan for large subnet size.

#### NAT Gateway

Azure Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway allows Windows containers, within a delegated subnet, to securely connect to internet resources. NAT Gateway ensures secure communication by translating the private IP addresses of container instances to a static, public IP address. Static IPs allow for consistent and secure outbound connections.

Enterprises need to configure NAT Gateway to prevent disruptions in existing integrations when onboarding a production environment to Virtual Network without migrating all data sources to the private network. This configuration allows enterprises to transition their integrations to Virtual Network without affecting current workloads.

#### Network monitoring

Network monitoring helps in tracking and analyzing the traffic flow within the delegated subnet. This monitoring is essential for identifying and resolving any potential issues. Monitoring ensures that the network is operating efficiently and securely by providing insights into the performance and health of the network components. Monitoring tools can detect anomalies, such as unusual traffic patterns or unauthorized access attempts, allowing for timely intervention and mitigation.

#### Network Security Group (NSG)

NSGs allow you to define security rules that control inbound and outbound traffic to and from your Azure resources. When delegating a subnet, you can configure NSGs to ensure that only authorized traffic is allowed. NSGs help in maintaining the security and integrity of the network by preventing unauthorized access and potential threats.

NSGs can be applied to both subnets and individual network interfaces, providing flexibility in managing traffic at different levels.
