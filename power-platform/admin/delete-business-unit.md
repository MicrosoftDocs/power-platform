# Disable and delete a business unit

You can delete a business unit to completely remove it. To delete a business unit, you must first disable it.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
>  Before deleting a business unit, be sure to consider the following:  
>   
> -   Deleting a business unit is irreversible.  
> -   The records owned by the business unit (for example: Teams, Facilities/Equipment, and Resource Groups) are deleted at the same time you delete the business unit.  
> -   You can't delete a business unit until you reassign all the business unit records to another business unit.
