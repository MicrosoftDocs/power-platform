# Privacy-related privileges

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

You can assign privileges to a security role that are related specifically to privacy. Use either the [new](security-roles-privileges.md#define-the-privileges-and-properties-of-a-security-role) or [legacy](security-roles-privileges.md#security-roles-and-the-legacy-ui) experience to assign privileges to a security role.

## New experience

The following table describes the privacy-related privileges, which in the new, modern UI are listed alphabetically on the **Privacy-related privileges** tab of the security role editor.

| Privacy-related privilege | Privilege name |
|---------------------------|----------------|
| Document Generation | prvDocumentGeneration |
| Dynamics 365 for mobile | prvUseTabletApp |
| Export to Excel | prvExportToExcel |
| Go Offline in Outlook | prvGoOffline |
| Mail Merge | prvMailMerge |
| Print | prvPrint |
| Sync to Outlook | prvSyncToOutlook |
| Use Dynamics 365 App for Outlook | prvUseOfficeApps |

## Legacy experience

All the privileges described in the previous table are grouped together on the **Business Management** tab of the legacy UI.
