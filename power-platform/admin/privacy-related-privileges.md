# Privacy-related privileges

This article provides information about **Privacy-related privileges** that are available with security roles.

You can specify privileges for each security role using the [new](security-roles-privileges.md#define-the-privileges-and-properties-of-a-security-role) or [legacy](security-roles-privileges.md#security-roles-and-the-legacy-ui) experience.

## New experience (preview)

Privacy-related privileges in the new, modern UI are listed alphabetically on the **Privacy-related privileges** tab of the security role editor.
