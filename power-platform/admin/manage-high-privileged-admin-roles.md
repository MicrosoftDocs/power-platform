# Manage admin roles with Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (preview)

[!INCLUDE [preview-banner](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner.md)]

Use Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM) to manage high-privileged admin roles in the Power Platform admin center.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren't meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - To sign up for this preview, fill out the [preview sign-up form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2259929).

## Prerequisites

- Remove old system administrator role assignments in your environments. You can use PowerShell scripts to inventory and remove unwanted users from the **System Administrator** role in one or more Power Platform environments.
- You must sign up for the preview by filling out the [preview sign-up form](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2259929).

## Changes to feature support

Microsoft doesn't automatically assign the **System Administrator** role for users with these Microsoft Entra ID roles (also called tenant admins):

- Global administrator
- Power Platform administrator
- Dynamics 365 administrator

Tenant admins can continue to sign in, to the Power Platform admin center, with these privileges:

- Enable or disable tenant level settings
- View analytics information for environments
- View capacity consumption

Tenant admins can't perform activities that require direct access to Dataverse data. Examples of these activities include:

- Updating the security role for a user in an environment
- Installing apps for an environment

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Tenant admins must do another step before they can perform activities requiring access to Dataverse. They must elevate themselves to the **System Administrator** role in the environment where they need access.

## Self-elevate to the system administrator role

Currently, we only support elevation using PowerShell. Future updates will include more enhancements in the Power Platform admin center.

### Set up PowerShell

Install the [MSAL](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/MSAL.PS) PowerShell module. You only need to install the module once.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name MSAL.PS
```

For more information about setting up PowerShell, see [Quick Start Web API with PowerShell and Visual Studio Code](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/quick-start-ps).

> [!NOTE]
> Users who call the self-elevation API must be a global admin, Power Platform admin, or Dynamic 365 admin. Otherwise, you get an access denied message.

### Step 1: Run the script to elevate

In this PowerShell script, you:

- Authenticate, using the Power Platform API.
- Build an `http` query with your environment ID.
- Call the API endpoint to request elevation.

#### Add your environment ID

1. Get your **Environment ID** from the **Environments** tab of the [Power Platform Admin Center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).

   :::image type="content" source="media/manage-high-privileged-admin-roles/get-env-id.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where you can get your environment ID.":::

1. Add your unique `<environment id>` to the script.

#### Run the script

Copy and paste the script into a PowerShell console.

```powershell
# Set your environment ID
$environmentId = "<your environment id>"

Import-Module MSAL.PS

# Authenticate
$AuthResult = Get-MsalToken -ClientId '49676daf-ff23-4aac-adcc-55472d4e2ce0' -Scope 'https://api.powerplatform.com/.default' 


$Headers = @{
   Authorization  = "Bearer $($AuthResult.AccessToken)"
   'Content-Type' = "application/json"
} 

$uri = "https://api.powerplatform.com/usermanagement/environments/$environmentId/user/applyAdminRole?api-version=2022-03-01-preview";

try { 

   $postRequestResponse = Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Headers $Headers -Uri $uri 
   
} 
   
catch { 
   
   # Dig into the exception to get the Response details. 
   
   Write-Host "Response CorrelationId:" $_.Exception.Response.Headers["x-ms-correlation-id"] 
   
   Write-Host "StatusCode:" $_.Exception.Response.StatusCode.value__  
   
   Write-Host "StatusDescription:" $_.Exception.Response.StatusDescription 
   
   $result = $_.Exception.Response.GetResponseStream() 
   
   $reader = New-Object System.IO.StreamReader($result) 
   
   $reader.BaseStream.Position = 0 
   
   $reader.DiscardBufferedData() 
   
   $responseBody = $reader.ReadToEnd(); 
   
   Write-Host $responseBody 
   
} 
   
$output = $postRequestResponse | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 2 
   
Write-Host $output
```

### Step 2: Confirm the result

Upon success, you see an output similar to the following output. Look for `"Code": "UserExists"` as evidence that you successfully elevated your role.

```powershell
{
  "errors": [],
  "information": [
    {
      "Subject": "Result",
      "Description": "[\"SyncMode: Default\",\"Instance df12c345-7b56-ee10-8bc5-6045bd005555 exists\",\"Instance df85c664-7b78-ee11-8bc5-6045bd005555 in enabled state\",\"Instance Url found https://orgc1234567.crm.dynamics.com\",\"User found in AD tenant\",\"User in enabled state in AD tenant\",\"SystemUser with Id:11fa11ab-4f75-ee11-9999-6045bd12345a, objectId:d111c55c-aab2-8888-86d4-ece1234f11e6 exists in instance\"]",
      "Code": "UserExists"
    },
    { ... }
}
```

#### Errors

You might see an error message if you don't have the right permissions.

```powershell
"Unable to assign System Administrator security role as the user is not either a Global admin, Power Platform admin, or Dynamics 365 admin. Please review your role assignments in Entra ID and try again later. For help, please reach out to your administrator."
```

### Step 3: Clean up activity

Run [Remove-RoleAssignmentFromUsers](https://github.com/microsoft/PowerApps-Samples/tree/master/powershell/UserManagement/Microsoft.PowerPlatform.Administration.UserManagement#remove-role-assignments-from-given-list-of-users) to remove users from the System Administrator security role after the assignment expires in PIM.

- `-roleName`: "System Administrator" or another role
- `-usersFilePath`: Path to CSV file with list of user principal names (one per line)
- `-environmentUrl`: Found at [admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/)
- `-processAllEnvironments`: (Optional) Process all your environments
- `-geo`: A valid GEO
- `-outputLogsDirectory`: Path where log files are written

#### Example script

```powershell
Remove-RoleAssignmentFromUsers
-roleName "System Administrator" 
-usersFilePath "C:\Users\<My-Name>\Desktop\<names.csv>"
-environmentUrl "<my-name>-environment.crm.dynamics.com"
# Or, include all your environments
-processAllEnvironments $true
-geo "NA"
-outputLogsDirectory "C:\Users\<My-Name>\Desktop\<log-files>"
```

## Known limitations

- When the caller is a system administrator, the self-elevate call returns a success rather than notifying the caller that the system administrator already exists.

- The user making the call must have tenant admin. For a full list of users who meet the tenant admin criteria, see [Changes to feature support](#changes-to-feature-support)

- The elevation API can only be invoked by the user who needs to elevate their status. It doesn't support making API calls on behalf of another user for elevation purposes.

- Calls to elevate aren't logged during preview. However, logging support will be added in the future.

- The Microsoft Power Platform CoE Starter Kit no longer works and we're working on updating the kit.

- Once you elevate a user through Entra Privileged Identity Management, wait for two hours for the changes to sync from Entra to Power Platform before you sign in to Power Platform admin center.

- Role assignments through groups aren't supported. Make sure that you assign roles directly to the user.
