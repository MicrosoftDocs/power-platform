# Use Power BI

Power BI works with model-driven apps in Microsoft Dataverse to provide a self-service analytics solution. The Power BI service automatically refreshes the data displayed. With [!INCLUDE[pn_power_bi_desktop](../includes/pn-power-bi-desktop.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_MS_Excel_Full](../includes/pn-ms-excel-full.md)] Power Query for authoring reports and Power BI for sharing dashboards and refreshing data from model-driven apps or Dynamics 365 apps, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service. Integrating Power BI with Dataverse provides the personnel in your organization a powerful way to work with data.  
  
## Enable Power BI visualization embedding  
 Before users can embed Power BI visualizations on personal dashboards, the organization-wide setting must be enabled.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  By default, Power BI visualization embedding is disabled and must be enabled before users can embed them in personal dashboards.  
  
### Enable Power BI visualizations in an environment  
  
1. In the Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

2. Select **Settings** > **Product** > **Features**.  
  
3. Under **Embedded content** set **Power BI visualization embedding** to **On** to enable or **Off** to disable.  
  
4. Select **Save**.
