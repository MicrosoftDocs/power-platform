# Download a template for data import

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Whether your data is stored in spreadsheets, databases, or other systems, you'll want to import the data into customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), so you can keep track of all your customer information in one place. You use templates for importing many types of records, such as accounts, leads or cases. There is a complete list in the Templates for Data Import wizard.  

These settings can be found in the Power Platform admin center by going to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Data management** > **Templates**.

Make sure you have the System Administrator or System Customizer security role or equivalent permissions to update the setting.

- Follow the steps in [View your user profile](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/user/view-your-user-profile).
- Don’t have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.
  
1. Select an environment and go to **Settings** > **Data management** > **Templates**.
  
2. In the **Templates for Data Import** dialog box, choose the record type that you want to download the template for, and then select **Download**.  
  
3. In the file download box, select **Save** or **Save as** and navigate to a location for the file.  
  
4. Select **Close**.
