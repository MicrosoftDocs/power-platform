# Add or remove sample data 

Sample data gives you something to experiment with as you learn customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), and helps you see how data is organized in the system. At some point, you'll probably want to remove the sample data.  
  
 Or, if sample data isn't installed on your system, you may want to add it for training purposes. Later, when you're ready, you can remove it.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Use sample data to learn and play around with system features. However, to avoid unwanted results, don't associate it with any data you actually need.  
  
1. Make sure you have the System Administrator security role or equivalent permissions.
  
    Check your security role
