# Add or remove sample data

You can use sample data in your Power Platform deployment to help you learn customer engagement apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation. Sample data helps you understand how data is organized in the system. You can install sample data on your system for training purposes or remove it based on your requirements.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can use sample data to learn and understand various features of the customer engagement apps. However, to avoid unwanted results, don't associate it with any production data.  

## In the Power Platform admin center
