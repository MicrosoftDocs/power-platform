# General availability deployment

Each release wave becomes _generally available_ twice a year. Your environments automatically receive these mandatory updates.

To test the upcoming updates, [opt in to early access updates](opt-in-early-access-updates.md).

> [!TIP]
> Check out [Dynamics 365 and Power Platform Release Plans](/dynamics365/release-plans/) to learn more about new features to be released in the release waves.

Throughout a release cycle, your environments update over the scheduled weekend. These scheduled windows are based on your environments' region. The specific dates when the updates occur are published to the [Message Center](/office365/admin/manage/message-center). The specific time when the updates for an environment complete, within the scheduled weekend, can't be predetermined.

Each notification from the Message Center includes dates, the maintenance window, and the Release Plan reference. In addition, included is a list of optimizations, fixes, and enhancements. Each environment should see the new features and build numbers by Monday morning, local time. For more information, see [Policies and communications](policies-communications.md#scheduled-system-updates-and-maintenance).  

The generally available platform version is based on your environment's database version.  These are the versions associated for each release:

| Release | Database version |
|---------|---------|
| April wave 1  | 9.2.26033.* |
| October wave 2 | 9.2.26093.* |

## Deployment schedule  

> [!Important]
> A release wave is a mandatory update and can't be postponed. These updates are essential for maintaining system integrity and security.
>
> The exact deployment day and time for your environment can't be calculated.

For each region listed, deployment begins on Friday evening dark hours and expected to complete before Monday start of business. For more information about dark hours for your region, see [Maintenance timeline](policies-communications.md#maintenance-timeline).
