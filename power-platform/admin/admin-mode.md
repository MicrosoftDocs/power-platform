# Administration mode  

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

You can set a sandbox, production, or trial (subscription-based) environment in administration mode so that only users with System Administrator or System Customizer security roles will be able to sign in to that environment. Administration mode is useful when you want to make operational changes and not have regular users affect your work, and not have your work affect end users (non-admins).  
  
> [!NOTE]
> - You can place sandbox, production, or trial (subscription-based) environments in administration mode.  
> - Processes that use code, such as plug-ins or custom workflow assemblies, continue to be processed by the Microsoft Dataverse platform when administration mode is enabled and background operations are disabled.
> - System Customizers will need to sign in to the environment directly through the URL as the environment in administration mode will not appear to System Customizers in the Environments page of the Power Platform admin center.
  
 On the **Settings** panel, you can set the following:  
  
|Setting|Description|  
|-------------|-----------------|  
|Administration mode | Select to enable administration mode for the selected sandbox, production, or trial (subscription-based) environment. Only System Administrators or System Customizers will be able to sign in to the selected sandbox or production environment.|  
|Background operations (optional) | Select to disable all asynchronous operations (see [Asynchronous service](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/asynchronous-service)) such as workflows and synchronization with Exchange. Emails will not be sent and server-side synchronization for appointments, contacts, and tasks are disabled. **Note:**  Administration mode must be enabled to disable background operations.|
