# Connect to Yammer 

<!-- legacy procedure -->

> [!NOTE]
> Effective February 2022, support for Microsoft 365 Groups (previously known as Office Groups) and Yammer in Dynamics 365 will be deprecated. This will impact customers who use Microsoft 365 Groups and/or Yammer for collaboration in Dynamics 365. We recommend that customers transition to Microsoft Teams for more advanced collaboration functionalities. For information about integrating Dynamics 365 with Teams, see [Integrate customer engagement apps in Dynamics 365 with Microsoft Teams](/dynamics365/teams-integration/teams-integration).
> 
> If you've questions about the deprecation, contact your Microsoft Customer Service representative or Microsoft Partner.

[!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] gives colleagues at your organization a central place to have conversations, create and edit documents, and share information without sending a single email or attending any meetings.  
  
 After you set up your organization to work with [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)], employees will see posts in a newsfeed on their customer engagement apps dashboard whenever people update customer info, and they'll be able to join in the conversation with their own posts.  
  
## Connect your organization to Yammer  
  
### Prerequisites  
  
- Before your organization can use [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] in customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), your organization needs to buy [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] enterprise licenses.  

- [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] integration is only available for customer engagement apps.
  
- [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin.md)]

   > [!NOTE]
   > Customer engagement apps only support connecting to the primary [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] network. Connecting to External Networks in [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] is not supported.

## Additional considerations  
  
### When connecting with a federated Yammer  
 If you have configured [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] to use single sign-on, you'll need to generate and use a temporary password to connect to [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)].  
  
1. Sign in to [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] with the single sign-on credentials.  
  
2. Choose **More commands (…)** > **Apps**  
  
3. Scroll to the bottom of the page to the **All Apps** section.  
  
4. Choose the **[!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)]** tab, and then choose an app like [!INCLUDE[pn_windows_phone](../includes/pn-windows-phone.md)]. The app must support generating a temporary password.  
  
5. Complete the process to obtain a temporary user name and password.  
  
6. Use the temporary user name and password to complete the customer engagement apps to [!INCLUDE[pn_yammer](../includes/pn-yammer.md)] connection configuration.

 Add your Yammer sites to your browser as trusted. For example, for customer engagement apps, add the following:  
  
- https://*.crm.dynamics.com  
  
- https://*.yammer.com  
  
- https://*.assets-yammer.com
