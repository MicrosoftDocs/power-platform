# Access audit data using Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse and Power BI

Customers who use Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse can export audit logs easily to meet the external and internal auditing, compliance, security, and governance policies that are common to many enterprises.

Microsoft Dataverse auditing is supported on all custom and most customizable tables and columns. Audit logs are stored in Dataverse and consume log storage capacity. If you have Azure resources in the same region as the Dataverse environment, you can export audit logs to an Azure storage account using Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse and query the audit logs using Azure Synapse Analytics and Power BI Desktop.

## Prerequisites

- An Azure subscription with admin permissions to create resource groups, workspace, and other Azure assets. More information: [Create an Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse with your Azure Synapse Workspace](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-synapse#prerequisites)
- You must have the Dataverse system administrator security role.
- Power BI.

## Tasks to complete

Here are the high-level steps for creating the storage and workspace in Azure, then the Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse so you can create reports in Power BI:

1. [Create an Azure Synapse Link](#create-an-azure-synapse-link)
   1. Create a resource group.
   1. Create an Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 account with hierarchical directory enabled.
   1. Create a Synapse workspace.
   1. Create an Apache Spark pool for the Synapse workspace.
   1. To enable your app maker the ability to create an Azure Synapse Link for Dataverse, grant storage account and synapse workspace permissions to the Power Platform maker.
1. [Connect Dataverse audit table to Synapse workspace](#connect-dataverse-audit-table-to-synapse-workspace)

   1. Select the **Storage account name** that you created earlier.
   1. Select **Create new** under the **File system name**.
   1. Enter a **Name** for the Data Lake Storage Gen2 file system.
1. Create a Spark pool for the Synapse workspace.
   1. Go to the resource group of the Synapse workspace that was created earlier.
   1. The storage account and the Synapse workspace are listed under **Resources**. Select the Synapse workspace you created in the above step.
   1. Select **+ New Apache Spark pool** to create a spark pool.
   1. On the new Apache Spark pool page:
     - Enter an Apache spark pool name.
     - Enter *5* in the **Number of nodes**.
     - Select the **Additional settings** tab, and then enter *5* for the **Number of minutes idle**.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - There are no costs incurred with the creation of Spark pools. Charges are only incurred once a Spark job is executed on the target Spark pool and the Spark instance is instantiated on demand. These costs are related to the usage of Azure Synapse workspace Spark and are billed monthly. The cost of conducting Spark computing mainly depends on the time interval for incremental update and the data volumes. More information: [Azure Synapse Analytics pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/synapse-analytics/)
> - It's important to take these additional costs into consideration when deciding to use this feature as they're not optional and must be paid in order to continue using this feature.

## Connect Dataverse audit table to Synapse workspace

To connect your Dataverse audit table to a Synapse workspace, you use the Azure Synapse Link that was created earlier in this article.

1. With a user account that has the Dataverse system administrator security role, sign into Power Apps and then select the environment you want.
1. Connect Dataverse to your Synapse workspace:
   1. On the left navigation pane, select **Azure Synapse Link**. If the item isn't available, select **More** > **Discover all**. Select **New link**.
   1. On the **New link** page:
      - Select the **Connect to your Azure Synapse Analytics workspace** option.
      - Select the Azure **Subscription**, the **Resource group**, and the **Storage account**.
      - Select the **Use Spark pool for Delta Lake data conversion job** option.
      - Select the **Spark pool** and **Storage account**.
   1. Select **Next**.
   1. Expand the **Advanced** tab and enter *480* minutes in the **Time interval** field. Later, you can change the duration for how frequent you want to refresh the Dataverse tables in the Synapse workspace.
   1. Under the list of tables, select the **Auditing** and **User** tables.

The tables you select must have change tracking enabled. More information: [Enable change tracking to control data synchronization](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/admin/enable-change-tracking-control-data-synchronization).
