# Datacenter regions

Microsoft Dynamics 365 and Microsoft Power Platform online services are being hosted in datacenters in more and more regions. After these services become available in a new region, the following apply:  
  
- For new organizations, the datacenter will be aligned with the country/region you selected during sign-up.  
  
- For existing organizations, [!INCLUDE[cc_Microsoft](../includes/cc-microsoft.md)] will soon accommodate migrations to datacenters in the new region when requested by the customer as long as the organization meets certain business requirements.  
  
For information about datacenter regions for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform, see [Product Availability by Geography](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/availability-reports/georeport/). Also, see [Where your data is located](https://www.microsoft.com/trust-center/privacy/data-location).
