# Plan for deployment and administration

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Your deployment will go more smoothly with some preliminary planning.  The following table lists some of the items to consider before you start the actual deployment process.

Identify current data that you would like to bring into customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), and your overall data storage requirements. Include a business requirements analysis that describes your organization’s expectation or requirements for a service level agreement (SLA). An SLA is an agreement between two or more parties describing the deliverables, support, and communication that each party will provide to the other. Specify your policies related to security and privacy.                                                                 |                                                                                                                                                                                                             Is there enough overlap in customers and products across business units to be able to work in the same data? What type of security policy does the organization already have in place? Are there any special requirements in this area? Is there a plan for business growth that could affect the number of users?<br /><br /> Plan for enough time to do this discovery; information that comes out of this exercise can affect the way you implement the service.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Administrative roles in the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)] |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        A number of administrative roles are available to assign to users if you manage your subscription in the [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_online_services_environment](../includes/pn-ms-online-services-environment.md)]. Administrative roles define administrative responsibilities related to subscription management activities, for example, billing administration, password administration, and user management administration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                                           Consider the available administrative roles and the needs of your environment to identify the roles you want to use and the users you will choose for each role. The global administrator role is the highest level role, having all the permissions to manage any part of the subscription process. We recommend that you assign this role to more than one person so that someone is always available to manage all aspects of the subscription. **Note:**  Administrative roles cover all subscription management functions within the service. These aren’t the same as the security roles that you assign to users, which are required and govern access to resources in the service. See “Security roles” in this table.                                            |

Review the documentation associated with each product update before you enable it in a production environment. Additionally, some product updates, such as the sales and service process forms, can’t be removed or easily reverted to the previous functionality. Therefore, you should give careful consideration before you enable a product update. **Tip:**  If you’re unsure whether you want to enable a product update in a environment used in production, sign up for a trial subscription to evaluate the new functionality.
