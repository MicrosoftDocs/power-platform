# Manage Microsoft Dataverse settings

You can view and manage the settings for your environments by signing in to the Microsoft [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com), going to the **Environments** page, selecting an environment, and then selecting **Settings**.

![Environment details.](media/environment-details.png "Environment details")

Settings for the selected environment can be managed here.

## Environment settings are moving
Across organization admin settings are gradually moving from the web client to the Power Platform admin center, apps with unified interface, or Power Apps. Meanwhile, youâ€™ll still be able to manage settings in customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), as usual.

Many of these settings...

...are moving here.

Use the links on this page to manage organization-wide settings. App-specific settings will remain in customer engagement apps and accessed through the app settings. 

## New location for admin settings
The following web client admin settings have moved.

### Security settings

These security settings are now managed in the Power Platform admin center.

- [Manage application users in the Power Platform admin center](manage-application-users.md)
- [Dataverse teams management](manage-teams.md)
- [Assign security roles to users in an environment that has a Dataverse database](database-security.md#assign-security-roles-to-users-in-an-environment-that-has-a-dataverse-database)

## App settings

Getting to app feature settings can vary based on the type of app you're using. 

When the **[Display behavior -> Use updated experience for classic settings where possible](settings-behavior.md#settings)** toggle is **On** , the following app settings have the modernized experience available in the unified interface.
