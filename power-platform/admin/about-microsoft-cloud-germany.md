# About the Microsoft Cloud Germany datacenter

[!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_germany](../includes/pn-dyn-365-germany.md)] address the needs of the most regulated customers in Germany, the European Union (EU), and the European Free Trade Association (EFTA). The German datacenter delivers services that bring together the best of Microsoft in productivity, collaboration, intelligence and platform to grow, evolve and transform your business.  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Due to the unique nature of [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_germany](../includes/pn-dyn-365-germany.md)], there are some features that have not yet been enabled. The key sales, marketing, and service features for customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), will be the same as in other regions. However, there may be external factors that are made available in other clouds, but will not be available to German cloud customers at this time.

## German Data Residency  
 Customer Data will be stored at rest in two independent, geographically dispersed datacenter locations in Germany. Replication of  Customer Data across these German datacenters ensures data remains in Germany even in backup, business continuity, and disaster recovery scenarios.  
  
 Customer Data means all data that are provided to Microsoft by, or on behalf of the customer through the use of customer engagement apps (such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service).  
  
 Note the following:  
  
- Customer Data is stored at rest in Germany  
  
- Access control is through  a German Data Trustee.  
  
- All security and compliance capabilities of customer engagement apps (such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service), are included.

## German Data Trustee  
 The German Data Trustee controls access to Customer Data by anyone except the customer or the customer’s end users. This means that access to Customer Data or the infrastructure on which Customer Data resides for performing operational tasks must be granted and supervised by the German Data Trustee, or else directly by the customer.  
  
 The German Data Trustee may also perform non-data specific tasks related to day-to-day datacenter operations.

## Compliancy and certifications  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_germany](../includes/pn-dyn-365-germany.md)] is built in adherence to the cloud security and compliance standards and commitments of customer engagement apps (such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service).  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_germany](../includes/pn-dyn-365-germany.md)] is planned to be covered under existing audits.  
  
-   Uses the same security and controls  
  
-   Includes ISO 27001, 27018, and SOC 1 and 2  
  
Data centers undergo audits like any other expansion.  
  
 The additional Data Trustee controls in [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_germany](../includes/pn-dyn-365-germany.md)] will be evaluated by independent assessors as part of our annual ISO and SOC.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_germany](../includes/pn-dyn-365-germany.md)] includes client software applications that are installed and run on an end user’s device (“client software applications”), such as [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_full](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-full.md)], [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_phones](../includes/pn-dyn-365-phones.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_dyn_365_tablets](../includes/pn-dyn-365-tablets.md)], and the [!INCLUDE[pn_unified_service_desk_for_crm](../includes/pn-unified-service-desk-for-crm.md)]. Client software applications do not operate exclusively in German data centers and may enable an end user to access online services that are not German Online Services. For purposes of your agreement with Microsoft, client software applications are not German Online Services. German Data Residency commitments and access control by German Data Trustee apply only to the German Online Services.
