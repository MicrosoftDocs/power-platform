# Access your storage

Storage has important data from your environment. As a Power Platform administrator, there are a couple ways you can access your storage:

- [Microsoft Fabric](#fabric)
- [Long term data retention](#long-term-data-retention)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Access to storage by using an SAS token is no longer available. Use one of the methods described here to securely access Microsoft Dataverse data for analysis and insights.

## Fabric

Access using the **Link to Fabric** feature to link your Dataverse environment to Fabric. More information: [Link your Dataverse environment to Microsoft Fabric and unlock deep insights](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/azure-synapse-link-view-in-fabric)

## Long term data retention

Access archived Microsoft Dataverse data that's no longer active and stored in file storage via long term retention. More information: [View long term retained data](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-retention-view)
