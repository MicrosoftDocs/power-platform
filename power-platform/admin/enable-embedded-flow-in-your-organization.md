# Enable Power Automate integration to automate processes

[!INCLUDE [cc-data-platform-banner](../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

Microsoft Power Automate lets you create automated processes between your favorite apps and services. The ability to run flows from within customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, make it simple for users to combine a broad spectrum of services that can be initiated from within Dynamics 365 apps, such as messaging, social engagement, and document routing services.

## Enable Power Automate in your organization  
 By default, all security roles allow users to run flows on the records that they have access to.  
  
 To enable Power Automate integration in your organization, follow these steps.  

1. In the Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

2. Select **Settings** > **Product** > **Behavior**.   
  
3. Under **Display behavior**, select **Show Power Automate on forms and in the site map** to Power Automate. Once enabled, this setting cannot be disabled again.

4. Select **Save**.

> [!TIP]
   >  The Power Automate menu only list flows that begin with the *When a record is selected* Microsoft Dataverse trigger and contain at least one trigger or action that references that entity.
