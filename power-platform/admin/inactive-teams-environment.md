# Automatic deletion of inactive Dataverse for Teams environments

Power Platform provides a cleanup mechanism that automatically removes [Microsoft Dataverse for Teams environments](about-teams-environment.md) from your tenant that are left inactive. An environment is first disabled after 90 days of inactivity. And then, deleted if administrators don't take any action and the environment is left disabled for 30 days. Administrators have seven days to recover deleted environments.

> [!NOTE]
> To understand automatic deletion of Power Platform environments that are not Dataverse for Teams environments, go to [Automatic deletion of inactive Power Platform environments](automatic-environment-cleanup.md).

A disabled or deleted environment doesn't affect any other Microsoft Teams assets (Teams, channels, SharePoint sites, Teams-connected sites, and so on) and applies only to Dataverse integrations. This cleanup process is automatic. If you no longer need an inactive Dataverse for Teams environment, you don't need to do anything.

Disabling a Dataverse for Teams environment prevents any meaningful use of the environment and its resources. Apps can't be launched, flows are suspended, chatbots can't be interacted with, and so on.

## Definition of user activity

Power Platform calculates a single measure of inactivity for each Dataverse for Teams environment. The measure accounts for all activity by users, makers, and admins across Power Apps, Power Automate, Microsoft Copilot Studio, and Dataverse.

User activities include most create, read, update, and delete operations on environment resources. Most read operations like visits to the home page, solution explorer, and Power Apps or Power Automate designer aren't considered activities.

Here are some examples of the types of activities that are included in the measure:

- **User activity**: Launch an app, execute a flow (whether automatic or not), chat with a Microsoft Copilot Studio bot.

- **Maker activity**: Create, update, or delete an app, flow (desktop and cloud flows), Microsoft Copilot Studio bot, custom connector.

- **Admin activity**: Environment operations such as copy, delete, back up, recover, reset.

Activity includes automated behaviors such as scheduled flow runs. For example, if there's no user, maker, or admin activity in an environment, but it contains a cloud flow that runs daily, then the environment is considered active.

## Notification recipients

The following users receive email notifications on the schedule described in the timeline:

- System administrators of the environment.

    A Dataverse for Teams environment is paired with a team in Microsoft Teams. The owners of the team are automatically granted the System Administrator role for the environment. They receive email notifications and can [trigger activity, re-enable, and recover the environment](#trigger-activity-re-enable-and-recover-a-dataverse-for-teams-environment) in the Power Platform admin center. Team members and guests don't receive the email notifications.

- The creator of the environment.
- If environment administrators are no longer part of the tenant, then the tenant administrators are notified.

Additionally, users and makers are notified on the Environment's list page and Environment page when the Dataverse for Teams environment is disabled.
