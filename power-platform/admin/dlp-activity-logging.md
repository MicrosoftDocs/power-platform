# Data loss prevention activity logging

> [!NOTE]
> Activity logging for data loss protection policies is not currently available in sovereign clouds.

Data loss protection (DLP) policy activities are tracked from the [Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance Center](/microsoft-365/?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true). 

To log DLP activities, follow these steps:

1. Sign in to the [Security & Compliance center](https://protection.office.com) as a tenant admin.

2. Select **Search** > **Audit log search**. 

3. Under **Search** > **Activities**, enter **dlp**. A list of activities appears.

   > ![Screenshot showing audit log search DLP policies.](media/audit-log-search-dlp.png "Audit log search DLP policies")

4. Select an activity, select outside the search window to close it, and then select **Search**.

On the **Audit log search** screen, you can search audit logs across many popular services including eDiscovery, Exchange, Power BI, Microsoft Entra ID, Microsoft Teams, customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), and Microsoft Power Platform. 

After you access **Audit log search**, you can filter for specific activities by expanding **Activities** and then scrolling to find the section dedicated to Microsoft Power Platform activities. 

## What DLP events are audited

The following are the user actions you can audit:

- Created DLP Policy: When a new DLP policy is created 
- Updated DLP Policy: When an existing DLP policy is updated 
- Deleted DLP Policy: When a DLP policy is deleted 
 
## Base schema for DLP audit events 

Schemas define which fields are sent to the [Microsoft 365 Security and Compliance Center](/microsoft-365/?view=o365-worldwide&preserve-view=true). Some fields are common to all applications that send audit data to Microsoft 365, while others are specific to DLP policies. In the following table, **Name** and **Additional Info** are the DLP policyâ€“specific columns. 

|Field name  |Type  |Mandatory  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|Date     |Edm.Date|No         |Date and time of when the log was generated in UTC          |
|App Name   |Edm.String         |No         |Unique Identifier of the PowerApp        |
|Id     |Edm.Guid         |No         |Unique GUID for every row logged          |
|Result Status     |Edm.String         |No         |Status of the row logged. Success in most cases.          |
|Organization Id     |Edm.Guid         |Yes        |Unique identifier of the organization from which the log was generated.       |
|CreationTime     |Edm.Date         |No         |Date and time of when the log was generated in UTC          |
|Operation     |Edm.Date         |No         |Name of operation         |
|UserKey     |Edm.String         |No         |Unique Identifier of the User in Microsoft Entra ID       |
|UserType     |Self.UserType         |No         |The audit type (Admin, Regular, System)         |
|Additional Info     |Edm.String        |No         |Additional information if any (e.g. the environment name)       |

### Additional Info 

The **Additional Info** field is a JSON object that contains operation-specific properties. For a DLP policy operation, it contains the following properties. 


|Field name   |Type  |Mandatory?  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|PolicyId     | Edm.Guid         | Yes        | The GUID of the policy.    |
|PolicyType     | Edm.String         | Yes        | The policy type. Allowed values are AllEnvironments, SingleEnvironment, OnlyEnvironments, or ExceptEnvironments.        |
|DefaultConnectorClassification     | Edm.String         | Yes        | The default connector classification. Allowed values are General, Blocked, or Confidential.        |
|EnvironmentName     | Edm.String         | No        | The name (GUID) of the environment. This is only present for SingleEnvironment policies.         |
|ChangeSet     | Edm.String         | No        | Changes made to the policy. These are only present for update operations.         |

The following is an example of the **Additional Info** JSON for a create or delete event.

```json
{ 
  "policyId": "eb1e0480-0fe9-434e-9ad8-df4047a666ec", 
  "policyType": "SingleEnvironment", 
  "defaultConnectorClassification": "General", 
  "environmentName": "8a11a4a6-d8a4-4c47-96d7-3c2a60efe2f5" 
} 
```

The following is an example of the **Additional Info** JSON for an update operation that: 

- Changes the policy name from oldPolicyName to newPolicyName. 
- Changes the default classification from General to Confidential. 
- Changes the policy type from OnlyEnvironments to ExceptEnvironments. 
- Moves the Azure Blob Storage connector from the General to the Confidential bucket.
- Moves the Bing Maps connector from the General to the Blocked bucket.
- Moves the Azure Automation connector from the Confidential to the Blocked bucket.

```json
{ 
  "policyId": "eb1e0480-0fe9-434e-9ad8-df4047a666ec", 
  "policyType": "ExceptEnvironments", 
  "defaultConnectorClassification": "Confidential", 
  "changeSet": { 
    "changedProperties": [ 
      { 
        "name": "ApiPolicyName", 
        "previousValue": "oldPolicyName", 
        "currentValue": "newPolicyName" 
      }, 
      { 
        "name": "DefaultConnectorClassification", 
        "previousValue": "General", 
        "currentValue": "Confidential" 
      }, 
      { 
        "name": "DlpPolicyType", 
        "previousValue": "OnlyEnvironments", 
        "currentValue": "ExceptEnvironments" 
      } 
    ], 
    "connectorChanges": [ 
      { 
        "name": "Azure Blob Storage", 
        "id": "/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/apis/shared_azureblob", 
        "previousValue": { 
          "classification": "General" 
        }, 
        "currentValue": { 
          "classification": "Confidential" 
        } 
      }, 
      { 
        "name": "Bing Maps", 
        "id": "/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/apis/shared_bingmaps", 
        "previousValue": { 
          "classification": "General" 
        }, 
        "currentValue": { 
          "classification": "Blocked" 
        } 
      }, 
      { 
        "name": "Azure Automation", 
        "id": "/providers/Microsoft.PowerApps/apis/shared_azureautomation", 
        "previousValue": { 
          "classification": "Confidential" 
        }, 
        "currentValue": { 
          "classification": "Blocked" 
        } 
      } 
    ] 
  } 
} 
```
