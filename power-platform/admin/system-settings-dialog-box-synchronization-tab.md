# System Settings Synchronization tab 

Use the settings on this page to determine how data is synchronized between customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)]. For example, you can control synchronization between pairs of fields or enable or disable synchronization of additional mailing addresses, assigned tasks, or appointment attachments.  
  
## Open the System Settings dialog box 
  
1. [!INCLUDE[proc_permissions_system_admin_and_customizer](../includes/proc-permissions-system-admin-and-customizer.md)]  
  
    Check your security role  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_follow_steps_in_link](../includes/proc-follow-steps-in-link.md)]  
  
   - [!INCLUDE[proc_dont_have_correct_permissions](../includes/proc-dont-have-correct-permissions.md)]  
  
2. In the Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

3. Select **Settings** > **Integration** > **Synchronization**.  

> [!TIP]
> In addition to the settings mentioned below, there are more settings available to control synchronization behavior. For more information, see [OrgDBOrgSettings for server-side synchronization](OrgDbOrgSettings.md).

This is sufficient for most organizations. If you want to synchronize all three Outlook mailing address fields (Business, Home, and Other fields) choose the **Synchronize all three addresses in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] contact** option. **Warning:**  Be cautious when enabling this option as it can cause data loss in some situations if you have existing data. This is due to the remapping of the attributes for existing tracked contacts. The best practice is to do in-house testing to understand how the re-mapping affects your environment and data. In most cases, you should have the full data in one side (normally in customer engagement apps) and sync to the other side (normally [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] or [!INCLUDE[pn_Exchange](../includes/pn-exchange.md)]). |
