# Manage collaboration settings

Use collaboration settings to adjust how collaboration features work in Power Platform. Adjust the settings in the Power Platform admin center, **Environments** > *select an environment* > **Settings** > **Product** > **Collaboration**.

## Prerequisites

[Make sure you have the System Administrator security role](/powerapps/user/view-your-user-profile) or equivalent permissions to change the collaboration settings. If you don't, ask your system administrator.

## End user experiences

- **Model-driven apps**:

  - **Show other people when they're using the same form**: When you're working on a record, you can also see other users who are working on the same record if this setting is set to **On**.

  - **End users can add and join Teams meetings from appointments in model-driven apps**: Teams meetings in model-driven apps include a **Join** button to allow users to easily join the call.

  - **Show modern share on views and dashboards (preview)**: The **Share** button is shown in views and dashboards, which makes it easy to copy links and share them with others.

- **Enable sharing**:

  - **Allow users to share read-only links to records with other users from this environment**: Users who have the share privilege can give read-only access to records when they share them with the **Specific people** option selected.

- **Teams integration**:

  - **Show record name and type to unauthorized users when unfurling links in Teams chats**: When a link is pasted into a Teams chat, display the name and type of record in a card.

  - **Install the Dynamics 365 app for Teams for users in the organization. Lets people in your org see business data while working in Teams**: Active users of Dynamics 365 apps and Power Apps model-driven apps get the Dynamics 365 app for Teams automatically installed in their Teams client.

## App authoring experiences

- **Coauthoring (preview)**: Enable [coauthoring](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/coauthoring), which lets people simultaneously edit model-driven apps together.
