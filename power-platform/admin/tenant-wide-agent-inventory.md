# Tenant-wide agent inventory

The Power Platform admin center now offers an enhanced, agent inventory experience, providing IT administrators with comprehensive visibility into all Copilot Studio agents created across their tenant. With this new agent inventory page, administrators can effortlessly discover, search, filter, and sort the entire inventory of agents by owner, creation date, region, and other key attributesâ€”streamlining common administrative tasks.
This inventory capability enables administrators to:

- **Accelerate support**: Quickly locate agents referenced in support tickets to improve response times.
- **Prevent orphaned agents**: Identify agents owned by departing users to proactively transfer ownership and maintain continuity.
- **Enforce compliance standards**: Easily detect agents created in non-approved regions, ensuring adherence to organizational compliance policies.
