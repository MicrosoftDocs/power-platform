      - question: |
          What's the best way to use Outlook and customer engagement apps together?  
        answer: |
           There are three ways to use model-driven apps in customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), and [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] together:  
            
           - [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)]  
            
           - [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_for_outlook_full](../includes/pn-crm-for-outlook-full.md)] 
            
           - [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Exchange](../includes/pn-microsoft-exchange.md)] folder tracking  
            
             Use [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)] paired with [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)] to view customer engagement apps data in [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] and track [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] records in customer engagement apps. You can use [!INCLUDE[pn_ms_dyn_crm_app_for_outlook](../includes/pn-ms-dyn-crm-app-for-outlook.md)] together with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_outlook_web_app](../includes/pn-microsoft-outlook-web-app.md)],  the [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] desktop application, or with [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] mobile. With [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)], customer engagement apps information appears next to a user’s [!INCLUDE[pn_Outlook_short](../includes/pn-outlook-short.md)] email messages or appointments. For example, people can preview information about contacts and leads stored in customer engagement apps and add contacts directly from an email message. They can also link email, appointment, and contact records  to new or existing records, such as  opportunity, account, or case records. To use [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_app_for_outlook_short](../includes/pn-crm-app-for-outlook-short.md)], you must synchronize email with [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)].

      - question: |
          How often are records synchronized through server-side sync?  
        answer: |
           If you synchronize records with [!INCLUDE[cc_server_side_synch](../includes/cc-server-side-synch.md)], the process is dynamic and unique for each user’s mailbox. The synchronization algorithm ensures that mailboxes are synced according to dynamic parameters such as the number of email messages and the activity within the mailbox. Normally, email synchronization occurs every 5 minutes. When a mailbox has many email messages, the interval can be reduced dynamically to 2 minutes. If the mailbox is less active, the interval can be increased up to 12 minutes. Generally speaking, you can assume that a mailbox will be synced at least once every 12 minutes. 
          
           However, when you use Dynamics 365 App for Outlook to track or set the regarding record for an email or appointment, synchronization happens immediately in most scenarios for received emails and sent appointments. If the immediate synchronization in Dynamics 365 App for Outlook fails, we leverage server-side synchronization to create or update the activity record.
            
      - question: |
          Where can I find information on troubleshooting server-side synchronization issues?  
        answer: |
           You can find information on troubleshooting and known issues here: [Troubleshooting and things to know about server-side synchronization](../admin/troubleshooting-monitoring-server-side-synchronization.md).  
            
      - question: |
          Do security permissions affect synchronization?  
        answer:  Yes. If a system administrator has implemented security for particular fields or records, it can affect the data that’s synchronized.
