# Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage your subscription 

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

[The Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoft-365/admin/admin-overview/admin-center-overview) is a portal site rich in features for the administrator. Microsoft 365, Power Platform, and Dynamics 365 admins can take advantage of the features on this site to simplify and consolidate management of user accounts, billing, licensing, and more.  

> [!NOTE]
>  You must have the global admin role to fully access the Microsoft 365 admin center.
  
## Check your service health  
You can view the health of your Microsoft services, including Office on the web, Microsoft Teams, Exchange Online, and Microsoft Dynamics 365 on the Service health page in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2024339). 
  
Learn more in [How to check Microsoft 365 service health](/microsoft-365/enterprise/view-service-health).  

## Review your messages  
Check out the Message center to keep track of upcoming changes, including new and changed features, planned maintenance, or other important announcements.
  
Click **Health** > **Message center**, and select messages to get more information.  

Learn more in [Message center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/message-center#preferences).

## Request support  
Having a problem with your service? You can create a support request to get the issue resolved.  
  
Learn more in [Contact Support](/microsoft-365/admin/get-help-support).

## Manage users  
Each user signs in to customer engagement apps with a Microsoft 365 user ID&mdash;more precisely, a Microsoft Entra ID user ID. Access to customer engagement apps is controlled through the Microsoft 365 user ID.

You use the Microsoft 365 admin center to add, edit, and delete users and to reset passwords.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Customer engagement apps use [Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis) as its identity provider. You access customer engagement apps through a Microsoft Entra ID user ID that is created and managed in the Microsoft 365 admin center. For simplicity, we refer to the Microsoft Entra ID user ID as the Microsoft 365 user ID in this documentation.
  
If your company uses on-premises Active Directory for user identity, you have options that can simplify user management such as providing a single sign-on experience for your users. Learn more in [Manage user account synchronization](manage-user-account-synchronization.md). 
  
## Manage subscriptions  
 Use the Billing page to adjust licenses, view your bill, add a partner of record, and lots more.  
  
## Configure self-service password reset and other settings in Azure  
If you have a Microsoft Entra ID Basic or Premium subscription, you can set it up so users can do their own password reset. You can access Microsoft Entra ID configuration from the Microsoft 365 admin center. Learn more in [Enable self-service password reset](/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr#enable-self-service-password-reset).  

> [!TIP]
>  Note the information on this page about users doing their own password reset. To allow your users to be able to reset their passwords themselves, you need to purchase a Microsoft Entra ID subscription and configure it for password self-service. Learn more in [Self-service password reset in Microsoft Entra ID: how to enable, configure, and test self-service password reset](/azure/active-directory/authentication/quickstart-sspr#enable-self-service-password-reset).  
  
On the left-side menu of the Microsoft 365 admin center, choose **Admin centers** > **Microsoft Entra**. Select your subscription in Azure and then choose **Configure**.  
  
## Add your domain  
Use the **Manage domains** page to add your domain to your subscription. When you add your own domain, user sign-ins can match your company's URL. For example, instead of `user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com`, it could be `user@contoso.com`. Learn more in [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](https://support.office.com/article/Verify-your-domain-in-Office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611).
  
## Purchase products  
 On the left-side menu of the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Billing** > **Purchase products** to add licenses or purchase new online services.
