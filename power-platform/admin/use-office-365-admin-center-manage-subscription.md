# Use the Microsoft 365 admin center to manage your subscription 

[The Microsoft 365 admin center](https://support.office.com/article/About-the-Office-365-admin-center-758befc4-0888-4009-9f14-0d147402fd23) is a portal site rich in features for the administrator. The customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), take advantage of the features on this site to simplify and consolidate management of user accounts, billing, licensing, and more.

> [!NOTE]
>  You must have the Global admin role to fully access the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)].  
  
## Check your service health  
 You can quickly get real-time status of your customer engagement apps and [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] services. The Service health page on the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)] provides a comprehensive view of the service health of your online services. If users are having trouble signing in to customer engagement apps, check this page to see if there is a service outage.  
  
For more information, see [Check your service health](check-online-service-health.md).  

## Review your messages  
 Check out the Message center to see how to fix or prevent issues, plan for service changes, or just to stay informed of new or updated features.

More information: [Contact Technical Support](get-help-support.md)

## Manage users  
 Each user signs in to customer engagement apps with an [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] user ID (more precisely, an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] user ID, see the following Note). Access to customer engagement apps is controlled through the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] user ID.  
  
 You use the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)] to add, edit, and delete users and to reset passwords.  
  
 ![Microsoft 365 admin center active users.](../admin/media/o365-admin-center-manage-users.png "Microsoft 365 admin center active users")  
  
> [!NOTE]
> Customer engagement apps use [Microsoft Entra ID](/azure/active-directory/active-directory-whatis) as its identity provider. You access customer engagement apps through an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] user ID that is created and managed in the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)]. For simplicity, we'll refer to the [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] user ID as the [!INCLUDE[pn_Office_365](../includes/pn-office-365.md)] user ID in this documentation.  
  
 If your company uses on-premises [!INCLUDE[pn_Active_Directory](../includes/pn-active-directory.md)] for user identity, you have options that can simplify user management such as providing a single sign-on experience for your users.

## Manage subscriptions  
 Use the Subscriptions page to adjust licenses, view your bill, add a partner of record, and lots more.  
  
 ![Microsoft 365 admin center subscriptions.](../admin/media/o365-admin-center-manage-subscriptions.png "Microsoft 365 admin center subscriptions")  
  
## Set the password expiration  
 Use the Security & privacy page to set how frequently a user's password expires and the number of days before a user is notified of an upcoming expiration.  
  
 ![Microsoft 365 admin center manage password expiration.](../admin/media/o365-admin-center-password-expiration.png "Microsoft 365 admin center manage password expiration")  
  
> [!TIP]
>  Note the information on this page about users doing their own password reset. To enable your users to be able to reset their passwords themselves, you'll need to purchase an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] subscription and configure it for password self-service. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Self-service password reset in Microsoft Entra ID: how to enable, configure, and test self-service password reset](/azure/active-directory/authentication/quickstart-sspr#enable-self-service-password-reset)  
  
## Configure self-service password reset and other settings in Azure  
 If you have an [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] Basic or Premium subscription, you can set it up so users can do their own password reset. You can access [!INCLUDE[pn_azure_active_directory](../includes/pn-azure-active-directory.md)] configuration from the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)]. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Enable users to reset their Microsoft Entra passwords]([Enable self-service password reset](/azure/active-directory/authentication/tutorial-enable-sspr#enable-self-service-password-reset)  
  
 On the left-side menu of the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)], choose **Admin centers** > **Microsoft Entra**. Select your subscription in [!INCLUDE[pn_Windows_Azure](../includes/pn-windows-azure.md)] and then choose **Configure**.  
  
 ![Microsoft Entra password policy.](../admin/media/o365-admin-center-azure-ad.png "Microsoft Entra password policy")  
  
## Add your domain  
 Use the Manage domains page to add your domain to your subscription. When you add your own domain, user sign-ins can match your company's URL. For example, instead of user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com, it could be user@contoso.com. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Add a domain to Microsoft 365](https://support.office.com/article/Verify-your-domain-in-Office-365-6383f56d-3d09-4dcb-9b41-b5f5a5efd611).
  
 ![Microsoft 365 admin center add your domain.](../admin/media/o365-admin-center-add0domain.png "Microsoft 365 admin center add your domain")  
  
## Purchase services  
 On the left-side menu of the [!INCLUDE[pn_office_365_admin_center](../includes/pn-office-365-admin-center.md)], click **Billing** > **Purchase services** to add licenses or purchase new online services.  
  
 ![Microsoft 365 admin center purchase services.](../admin/media/o365-admin-center-purchase-services.png "Microsoft 365 admin center purchase services")
