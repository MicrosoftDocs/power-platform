You can recover a recently deleted environment ([within seven days of deletion](backup-restore-environments.md#how-long-are-my-manual-on-demand-backups-and-system-backups-retained)) by using the Microsoft Power Platform admin center or the [Recover-AdminPowerAppEnvironment](/powershell/module/microsoft.powerapps.administration.powershell/recover-adminpowerappenvironment?view=pa-ps-latest) Power Apps cmdlet. Production environments with Dynamics 365 applications will be available for up to 28 days.

> [!NOTE]
> Available storage capacity might be required in order to successfully recover an environment depending on the type of environment being recovered. For information on viewing your current storage capacity, see [Microsoft Dataverse storage capacity](capacity-storage.md).
