# Microsoft Power Platform self-service analytics schema definition (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This topic discusses the contents of the data exported from Power Platform to Azure Data Lake Gen2 storage locations.  

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - This feature is being gradually rolled out across regions and might not be available yet in your region.

## Structure of the data output

When you export Power Apps and Power Automate inventory and usage data to your Data Lake Storage, self-service analytics makes the data available in a [Common Data Model](/common-data-model/) schema format. This Common Data Model-based metadata makes it possible for you to share your data across applications and business processes, such as Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, Dynamics 365, and Azure.

The data export file includes:  

- A full inventory for all apps, flows, connectors, and associated metadata that exist in the tenant.

- Usage data comprising data starting from the time that the export starts.

After the first time you generate a data export, Power Automate generates incremental daily updates. Each daily update includes details about all new and existing apps, including connector information. The data export contains the Microsoft Entra *principal object ID (userid)*. Optionally, you can further use Microsoft Entra to retrieve actual usernames and business units, such as marketing, sales, or finance.

## Power Apps folder structure
The main root folder for Power Apps has the following folder structure:

- \Applications
- \ConnectionReference
- \Connections
- \Environments
- \Usage

## Power Automate folder structure

The main root folder for Power Automate has the following folder structure:

- \Flows
-	\FlowsConnectionReference
-	\Usage

## Viewing the data and folders inside Azure portal

Data listed in these folders can be viewed through your Azure portal. To learn more, go to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com/). Then, navigate to your storage account (**Home** > **Subscriptions** > *your subscription name* > **Resource Groups** > *your resource group* > *your storage accounts* > **Storage Account**).

## The structure of the containers and folders inside the data lake

- The main root folder is in the yyyy-mm-dd date format (for example, 2020-02-28).

- The root folder contains two folders: Metadata and KPI: 
  - The Metadata folder contains inventory data in a list of files, one for each region.
  - The KPI folder contains usage data.

## Schema definition tables

The following tables detail the schema definitions of the data. Metadata are considered as inventory data.
