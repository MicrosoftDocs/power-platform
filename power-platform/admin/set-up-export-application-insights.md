# Set up exporting to Application Insights 

## Prerequisites

1. Ensure that you have an [Application Insights environment](/azure/azure-monitor/app/create-workspace-resource) set up for receiving the data, in addition to the [environment](environments-overview.md) that has a database. 
   - For the Application Insights environment, you must have contributor, writer, or admin rights.
   - The Application Insights environment must be unique for an environment or tenant. Note that Application Insights out-of-the-box reports won't function correctly if a single Application Insights environment contains data from multiple environments.
2. To set up data export in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) you'll need one of these roles: Power Platform Service admin, Dynamics 365 admin, or Microsoft 365 Global admin. 

## Set up export to your Applications Insights environment from the Power Platform admin center

1. In the Power Platform admin center, select **Data Export** > **New data export**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Data export.](media/data-export.png "Data export")

2. Select **Export to Application Insights**. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Data export to Application Insights.](media/data-export-application-insights.png "Data export to Application Insights")

3. Search for the environment that you'll set up for the Application Insights data export setup. You can choose to filter based on the environment type.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select an environment type.](media/data-export-application-insights-select-environment-type.png "Select an environment type")

   Choose the environment you want, and then select **Save**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Select an environment.](media/data-export-application-insights-select-environment.png "Select an environment")

4. Choose the Azure subscription, resource group, and Application Insights environment, and then select **Create**. You must have contributor, writer, or admin rights to the Application Insights environment. Typically, one production environment or tenant maps to one Application Insights environment. 

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Data export Application Insights details.](media/data-export-application-insights-details.png "Data export Application Insights details")

5. The data export connection should now be set up. In the next 24 hours, data will start being exported to your Application Insights environment.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Data export success.](media/data-export-application-insights-success.png "Data export success")

6. To stop the data export to Application Insights, select **Delete export**. You can set up a new connection whenever you decide to restart the data export.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Delete export.](media/data-export-delete.png "Delete export")
