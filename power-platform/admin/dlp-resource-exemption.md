# DLP resource exemption

You can define a list of exempted resources (canvas app, cloud flow, desktop flow, or chatbot) that will not be evaluated by a DLP policy by using [DLP resource exemption PowerShell cmdlets](powerapps-powershell.md#dlp-resource-exemption-cmdlets). You can exempt up to 2,000 low-code resources per DLP policy.
