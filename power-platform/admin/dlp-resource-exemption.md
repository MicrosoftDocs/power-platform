# DLP resource exemption

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Effective March 2024, the data loss prevention (DLP) resource exemption feature is deprecated for tenants that have never used it before.  By October 2024, the resource exemption feature will be deprecated for all customers.  

You can define a list of exempted resources (canvas app, cloud flow, desktop flow, or chatbot) that won't be evaluated by a DLP policy by using [DLP resource exemption PowerShell cmdlets](powerapps-powershell.md#dlp-resource-exemption-cmdlets). You can exempt up to 2,000 low-code resources per DLP policy.
