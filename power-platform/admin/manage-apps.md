# Manage Dynamics 365 apps

You can now use the Microsoft Power Platform admin center to install, configure, and manage Dynamics 365 apps that run on [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro). Apps in this topic refer to Dynamics 365 apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, and Dynamics 365 Marketing as well as apps purchased from Microsoft AppSource requiring any of these Dynamics 365 licenses.

> [!NOTE]
> You can install and manage Dynamics 365 apps only in an environment that was created with a database and with Dynamics 365 apps enabled during the environment creation. A valid Dynamics 365 license is required to enable Dynamics 365 apps during the environment creation. More information: [Create an environment with a database](./create-environment.md#create-an-environment-with-a-database)

You can manage apps from either the [tenant level](#tenant-level-view-of-apps) or the [environment level](#environment-level-view-of-apps).

## Tenant-level view of apps

App management in the **Applications** tab of the Dynamics 365 admin center is now done from the tenant-level view of apps in the Power Platform admin center. Follow these steps to see a list of all licensed Dynamics 365 apps for your tenant.

|Legacy app management  | New app management  |
|---------|---------|
| ![Legacy tenant view](media/app-management-legacy-application.png "Legacy tenant view")    | ![New tenant view](media/app-management-tenant-view-sm.png "New tenant view")        |

Follow these steps to see a list of all licensed applications for your tenant.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).

2. Select **Resources** > **Dynamics 365 apps** from the left-side menu.

   You'll see a list of installed or available to install or configure Dynamics 365 apps for the signed-in user. An admin will see all installed or available to install apps.

   Duplicate items will appear under **Name** if you have the same app license applied to multiple environments.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Manage apps tenant view.](media/app-management-install-app4.png "Manage apps tenant view")

   Note the following under **Status**:

   - **Enabled**: This app is ready to be installed in your environments. 
   - **Configured**: This app has been configured to an environment. It can be reconfigured to a different environment or configuration to current environment can be updated.
   - **Not configured**: This app is ready to be configured to an environment.

3. From the top menu bar, depending on the status of the app, you can do the following:

    - **Manage**: Select to go to a page where you can manage your app. 
    - **Details**: See information about the app such as the publisher.
    - **Install app**: Install certain applications to the selected environment for which you have permissions. Once an environment is selected, you'll see a list of packages to be installed.

4. If your tenant is multigeo, you can change the locale with the region selector.

   > ![Select region.](media/app-management-region-select.png "Select region")

## Environment-level view of apps

In addition to the environment level, solution management can also be done from the environment-level view in the Power Platform admin center.

|Legacy app management  | New app management  | 
|---------|---------|
| ![Legacy solution view](media/select-solution-upgrade2.png "Legacy solution view")  | ![New tenant view2](media/app-management-environment-view-sm.png "New tenant view2")        |

Follow these steps to see a list of all the licensed applications you installed for your environment.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).

2. Select **Environments** and then select an environment.

3. Under **Resources**, select **Dynamics 365 apps**.

   You'll see a list of Dynamics 365 apps installed **by you** in the selected environment.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Environment view.](media/app-management-environment-view.png "Environment view")

4. Select an app. From the top menu bar, depending on the status of the app, you can do the following:

    - **Install app**: Admins can install certain applications to the selected environment for which they have permission. Once an environment is selected, you'll see a list of packages to be installed.
    - **Open AppSource**: Select to install an app from AppSource.
    - **Update**: Appears if an update is available. Select to update the package.
    - **Details**: See information about the app such as the publisher.

2. Select an environment, review the packages to be installed, agree to the terms of service, and then select **Install**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"]

   You'll navigate to the environment-level view where you can see the installation status.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Environment view3.](media/app-management-environment-view3.png "Environment view3")

## FAQ

### Don't see your environment?

The number of environments admins see in the **Select an environment** drop-down list will be less than or equal to the number of environments displayed on the **Environments** page in the Power Platform admin center. Check that no filter is applied on the **Environments** page.    

Filters are applied to the **Select an environment** drop-down list as follows:
1. Displays environments based on the [geographic region](regions-overview.md); selected by the admin in the tenant-level view.
2. Displays environments that only have a database.
3. Displays environments that are only in a ready state.
