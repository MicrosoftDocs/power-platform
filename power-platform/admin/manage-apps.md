# Manage Dynamics 365 apps

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

You can use the Microsoft Power Platform admin center to install, configure, and manage Dynamics 365 apps that run on [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro). Apps in this topic refer to Dynamics 365 apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, and Dynamics 365 Marketing as well as apps purchased from Microsoft AppSource requiring any of these Dynamics 365 licenses.

> [!NOTE]
> You can install and manage Dynamics 365 apps only in an environment that was created with a database and with Dynamics 365 apps enabled during the environment creation. A valid Dynamics 365 license is required to enable Dynamics 365 apps during the environment creation. More information: [Create an environment with a database](./create-environment.md#create-an-environment-with-a-database)

You can manage apps from either the [tenant level](#tenant-level-view-of-apps) or the [environment level](#environment-level-view-of-apps).

## Troubleshooting installation error
<!-- fwlink  2182141 -->
If you see the following error:

"Installing Dynamics 365 apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service is only supported on environments that have been created with a database with the option to **Enable Dynamics 365 apps** set to **Yes**. Try installing this application in an environment with a database and **Enable Dynamics 365 apps** enabled on it."

You'll need to create a new environment as directed in [Create an environment with a database](create-environment.md#create-an-environment-with-a-database). In step **Enable Dynamics 365 apps**, be sure to set **Yes**.

## Troubleshooting a failed installation

If the app installation has failed, its status will be marked **Installation failed**. Select **Details** from the command bar to view the error details page. 

If it's necessary to [contact Support](support-overview.md), be sure to provide the details listed on the error details page.

## Delete an app

## FAQ

### Don't see your environment?

The number of environments admins see in the **Select an environment** drop-down list will be less than or equal to the number of environments displayed on the **Environments** page in the Power Platform admin center. Check that no filter is applied on the **Environments** page.    

Filters are applied to the **Select an environment** drop-down list as follows:
1. Displays environments based on the [geographic region](regions-overview.md); selected by the admin in the tenant-level view.
2. Displays environments that only have a database.
3. Displays environments that are only in a ready state.
