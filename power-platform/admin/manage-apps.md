# Manage Dynamics 365 apps

You can use the Microsoft Power Platform admin center to install, configure, and manage Dynamics 365 apps that run on [Microsoft Dataverse](/powerapps/maker/common-data-service/data-platform-intro). Apps in this topic refer to Dynamics 365 apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, and Dynamics 365 Marketing as well as apps purchased from Microsoft AppSource requiring any of these Dynamics 365 licenses.

> [!NOTE]
> You can install and manage Dynamics 365 apps only in an environment that was created with a database and with Dynamics 365 apps enabled during the environment creation. A valid Dynamics 365 license is required to enable Dynamics 365 apps during the environment creation. More information: [Create an environment with a database](./create-environment.md#create-an-environment-with-a-database)

You can manage apps from either the [tenant level](#tenant-level-view-of-apps) or the [environment level](#environment-level-view-of-apps).

## Tenant-level view of apps

App management in the **Applications** tab of the Dynamics 365 admin center is done from the tenant-level view of apps in the Power Platform admin center. Follow these steps to see a list of all licensed Dynamics 365 apps for your tenant.

   You'll see a list of installed or available to install or configure Dynamics 365 apps for the signed-in user. An admin will see all installed or available to install apps.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![Manage apps tenant view.](media/app-management-install-app4.png "Manage apps tenant view")

   Note the following under **Status**:

   - **Configured**: This app has been configured to an environment. It can be reconfigured to a different environment or configuration to current environment can be updated.

    - **Details**: See information about the app such as the publisher.
    - **Install app**: Install certain applications to the selected environment for which you have permissions. Once an environment is selected, you'll see a list of packages to be installed.

4. If your tenant is multigeo, you can change the locale with the region selector.

## Troubleshooting installation error
<!-- fwlink  2182141 -->
If you see the following error:

"Installing Dynamics 365 apps such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Dynamics 365 Customer Service is only supported on environments that have been created with a database with the option to **Enable Dynamics 365 apps** set to **Yes**. Try installing this application in an environment with a database and **Enable Dynamics 365 apps** enabled on it."

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Installing this app is only supported on environments that have been created with a database with option to enable apps.](media/install-app-error.png "Installing this app is only supported on environments that have been created with a database with option to enable apps.")

You'll need to create a new environment as directed in [Create an environment with a database](create-environment.md#create-an-environment-with-a-database). In step 4, be sure to set **Enable Dynamics 365 apps** to **Yes**.

## FAQ

### Don't see your environment?

The number of environments admins see in the **Select an environment** drop-down list will be less than or equal to the number of environments displayed on the **Environments** page in the Power Platform admin center. Check that no filter is applied on the **Environments** page.    

Filters are applied to the **Select an environment** drop-down list as follows:
1. Displays environments based on the [geographic region](regions-overview.md); selected by the admin in the tenant-level view.
2. Displays environments that only have a database.
3. Displays environments that are only in a ready state.
