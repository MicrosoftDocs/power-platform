# Get Support

Admins can use the [Support experience](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/support/requests) in the [Power Platform admin center](admin-documentation.md) to get self-help solutions for an issue. If the issue can't be resolved through self-help, you can continue in the same **Support** experience to engage Microsoft support representative using your support plan. Should you need to link a plan with your account, you provide your access ID and password.

## Prerequisites

### Security roles
You must have on of the following security roles:

- Billing Admin
- Company Admin
- Compliance Admin
- CRM Organization Admin
- CRM Service Admin
- Environment Admin (or System Admin in Dataverse)
- Exchange Admin
- Helpdesk Admin
- LCS User
- Microsoft Entra Role Admin
- Partner Delegated Admin
- Power Apps Environment Admin
- Power Apps Full Admin
- Power BI Admin
- Power Platform Admin
- Security Admin
- Service Admin
- SharePoint Admin
- Teams Admin

### Support plans
You can access self-help resources in the Support experience without a support plan. However, to create a request, you must have an active support plan. 

- Subscription Support
- Professional Direct Support
- Unified Support

[Learn more about and purchase support plans](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics-365/support).

> [!Note]
> In the following cases, you might not be able to create a support request, or we can't provide solutions:
> - There's an issue with your Unified or Premier Support contract. Contact your Incident Manager or Customer Success Account Manager (CSAM).
> - Your Support subscription has expired. Renew.
> - We couldn't find your support plan.
>    - If you have a Unified or Premier Support plan, contact your Incident Manager or Customer Success Account Manager (CSAM).
>    - If you have a non-Unified/Premier Support plan, verify the plan is active. For support information, see [Community forums](https://community.dynamics.com/forums/thread/).

## Request support
There are two experiences depending on your tenant and scenario. Most will see the new Support agent, but some may see the older experience.

While the Support agent is in preview state, users can switch between experiences by selecting the â€¦ menu or toggle in the upper-right of the panel.

### Use the support agent (preview)
The Support agent is an agentic chat which takes you through a workflow to resolve your issue. It is an expanding and evolving service with improvements being made and tested all the time. However, it is not purely a virtual support experience. You can find self-help solutions, create a support request, and engage Microsoft representatives. The Support agent has several sequential phases.
