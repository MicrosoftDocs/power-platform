# Get Help + Support 

Admins can use the **Help + support** experience in the [Power Platform admin center](admin-documentation.md) to get self-help solutions in ***real-time*** for their issue. If the issue can't be resolved through self-help, you can use the same **Help + support** experience to contact a Microsoft support representative. 

An example of solutions provided for Dynamics 365 App for Outlook issues:

3. Select the product with the issue. Fill in the problem type, a description of the issue, and then select **See solutions**.

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![](media/create-support-ticket.png "See solutions")

   Based on the information you provided, you'll see a list of possible solutions to your issue. Select the relevant solution and see if the content can successfully guide you to a fix. 

4. If the guidance doesn't resolve your issue, scroll down and select **Create a support request** and fill in the fields in the form pages.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you have one of the plans listed in [Prerequisites](#prerequisites), you can set the severity to a higher level than **Minimal**.

5. If you have a **Premier** support plan, select **Yes** for **File as a Premier support request?** and fill in the fields. If you don't know your access or contract ID, please contact your service admin or Technical Account Manager (TAM).

   > [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
   > ![](media/premier-support.png "Premier support info")

> [!NOTE]
> - For **Contract ID/Password**, please enter your Premier contract ID. 
> - The **Contract ID/Password** defaults to the Premier contract ID. If you have changed the password when registering online in the Premier portal, you should use the updated password instead of the contract ID.

Once you submit your request it will appear in the list of support requests.
