# Business continuity and disaster recovery

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

Businesses expect their applications and customer data to be protected and resilient during unavoidable outages and disruptions. It's important to have a documented business continuity plan that aims to minimize the effects of outages including stakeholders, processes, and specific steps to be taken to recover and resume operations.

Microsoft provides business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) capabilities to all [production type environments](environments-overview.md) in Dynamics 365 and Power Platform software as a service (SAAS) applications. This article describes details and practices Microsoft takes to ensure your production data is resilient during outages.

The diagram below shows a typical architecture of a geography that serves a single or multiple countries. Although the geography location is all your Power Platform administrators need to be concerned with, within the geography, Microsoft deploys additional infrastructure to provide scale and added protection for your data.

:::image type="content" source="media/bcdr_architecture.png" alt-text="The diagram below shows a typical architecture of a geography that serves a single or multiple countries.":::

A geography includes at least one Azure region that is typically made up of three [availability zones](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview?tabs=azure-cli), but no less than two availability zones. 

## Built-in disaster recovery in-region with Azure availability zones

Microsoft recognizes that infrastructure components such as network, power, or cooling can fail unexpectedly, for example, due to a lightning strike. This could affect one or more datacenters. To ensure resilience, we architected and deployed availability zones, where your environments are replicated across at least two distinct zones.

Microsoft automatically detects availability zone-level failures and switches to other availability zones in the region almost instantly. This protects you from any data loss, and usually, the downtime is near zero. This in-region capability is available for production-type environments which are expected to host business-critical application processes and data. Please ensure that you protect yourself against disruption by making sure your production processes and data are not deployed in non-production types such as sandbox, developer, or trial environment types.

To ensure seamless disaster recovery, availability zones provide built-in resilience without requiring manual intervention. Customer data is synchronously replicated across at least two availability zones, resulting in zero data loss. The recovery point objective is zero and the rapid recovery, or recovery time objective, is less than five minutes. If one zone experiences a failure, traffic is automatically rerouted to the remaining zones with minimal service disruption.

## Backup of production environments

The transition to availability zones represents a significant improvement over the earlier backup and failover process for Dynamics 365 and Power Platform workloads. Those workloads typically required contacting customer support for manual intervention. Your data and services remain highly available within the primary region, with built-in, real-time redundancy across multiple zones.

Key improvements include:

- **Always-on resilience**: Your environments are now automatically replicated across multiple availability zones, eliminating the need for separate geo-secondary backups.
- **Faster recovery**: With synchronous replication across zones, failover within a region is almost instantaneous, minimizing disruptions and minimal data loss.
- **Seamless experience**: Unlike traditional backups, which require restoration, availability zones keep your environment continuously active.
- **Reduced support dependency**: Automated failover within the primary region eliminates the need to contact Microsoft support for most disaster recovery scenarios.

A limited number of customers in certain regions are in the process of transitioning to the improved architecture. Whether the region has transitioned or is in the process, the service always keeps a backup of environment data in more than one data center.

Availability zones are far enough apart to reduce the likelihood of an outage affecting more than one zone, but close enough to have low-latency connections to other availability zones. The distance between availability zones is usually 60 miles, or 100 kilometers. 

Customers that require greater distance within a geography can choose to use self-service disaster recovery to maintain a copy in a secondary region. With this feature, customers can control failover operations and perform disaster recovery drills as described in the following section.

## Cross-region self-service disaster recovery (preview)

[!INCLUDE [file-name](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]
[!INCLUDE [file-name](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-pp.md)]

Most geographies are typically made up of region pairs with a minimum distance of 300 miles whenever possible, to protect your data in case of large-scope disasters. 

Disaster recovery is a Power Platform infrastructure capability that allows customers to replicate their environment across far distances and initiate environment failover between regions in a self-serve manner.

Customers typically have multiple environments of different types created in their tenant. This capability is available specifically for production-type, [Managed Environments](managed-environment-overview.md) and can be turned on for each environment. Currently, this capability is not available for finance and operations production environments.

## Self-service disaster recovery cost and billing

Environments that activate disaster recovery replicate all environment data between two regions and can failover between the regions. Replicated data of different storage types, such as Database, Log, and File are added to Dataverse capacity consumed and billed at the same rate as the primary storage.

To use self-serve disaster recovery for an environment, the environment must first be linked to a [pay-as-you-go billing plan](pay-as-you-go-overview.md).

If your environment already uses a pay-as-you-go billing plan, then no further action is needed and replicated capacity is billed to your Azure subscription.

If your environment is configured to draw capacity from your tenantâ€™s Dataverse capacity entitlement, then entitled capacity is consumed first, A pay-as-you-go billing plan is still required so you can avoid capacity overages. Learn how to allocate capacity and manage capacity overages through pay-as-you-go billing plans. Learn more in [View usage and billing information](/power-platform/admin/pay-as-you-go-usage-costs).

## Turn on self-service disaster recovery

After you set up billing as outlined above, you can turn on self-service disaster recovery for an environment. This is a one-time action that provisions resources and starts the process of replicating data between the primary location and secondary location. This may take up to 48 hours to complete. Admins receive a notification when the process is complete.

Turning on disaster recovery in an environment has no impact on the environment or the data within it.

To turn on disaster recovery, complete the following steps.

# [New admin center](#tab/new)

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com) as a system administrator.
1. In the navigation pane, select **Manage**.
1. In the Manage pane, select **Environments**. The Environments page is displayed.
1. Select the production-type environment where you want to turn on self-service disaster recovery.
1. Select **Disaster Recovery** in the command bar at the top of the page. The **Disaster Recovery** pane appears.
1.	Select the toggle to change it to **Enabled**.
1.	Select **Save**.
1.	The environment is placed in the **Edit details** page briefly.
1.	The **Environment details** page appears, indicating that the process of turning on the feature has started.

These two events may require you to use this feature:

- Disaster recovery drill.
- Emergency response in the event of a major regional outage.

## Disaster recovery drills

Your company may have disaster recovery drills documented as a requirement in your internal business continuity plans. Some industries and companies may be required by government regulations to perform audits on their BCDR capabilities. In these cases, you may run a disaster recovery drill on an environment. A disaster recovery drill allows you to perform self-service disaster recovery without losing any data. The duration of the failover action may be slightly longer while all remaining data is being replicated to the secondary region.

We recommend performing drills on a copy of a production environment, since this involves downtime that can last for minutes. For example, you may want to copy a production environment to a sandbox-type environment and then change the type from sandbox to production.

## Emergency response failover

You would choose this option during an emergency, that is, when the primary region has sustained an outage and access to environments or data isn't possible. If you choose this option, the environment fails without copying any more data other than the data that has been replicated before the outage occurred.

When you perform an emergency response, you see the amount of data loss represented in time, which you can compare to your recovery point objective (RPO) if you determine that it's acceptable and you choose to continue. The environment operates in a Running state until the disaster recovery is complete, and the environment is back to normal operation from the secondary region.

## Switching back to primary region

After you complete your drill or after an outage has been mitigated, we recommend that you switch back the environment to its primary region. An environment may be operating with limited resources in the paired region. There's no loss of data during this operation.

## Environment disaster recovery status

Admins can determine the current disaster recovery state and location of an environment in the **Environment details** page. Admins can also select **Disaster Recovery** in the command bar to open the **Disaster Recovery** pane.

To check data replication latency at any time, you can select **Disaster Recovery** and then select **Emergency response** as the disaster recovery reason. This opens a confirmation dialog that includes the last replication time between regions for that environment. You may select **Cancel** if your only purpose was to check the potential loss of data if there was a failover operation. Keep in mind that the last sync time is always different at different times, since data is being replicated continuously.

## Document your business continuity plan

We recommend that you perform disaster recovery drills or an emergency response before a real disaster strikes, so you can document all steps required for any integration points that are external to Power Platform. Your company is then more prepared for recovery if there's a real disaster.

## Note about preview
During the preview, there is no charge for this feature, and you can't turn it off. When the feature reaches general availability, preview customers can keep the functionality by following the cost and billing details listed above in this article or allow it to be turned off by Microsoft. There will be no impact on your primary environment location or capabilities if you choose not to upgrade during general availability.

Microsoft provides business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) capabilities to all [production type](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview) environments in Dynamics 365 and Power Platform software as a service (SAAS) applications. This article describes details and practices Microsoft takes to ensure your production data is resilient during a regional outage.

## Backup of production environments

Microsoft is dedicated to ensuring the highest [service availability](https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/) levels for your critical applications and data. Microsoft ensures that the baseline infrastructure and platform services are available through its business continuity and [disaster recovery](/azure/reliability/disaster-recovery-overview) architecture by allowing geo redundancy, where all data from production environments&mdash;excluding Default environments&mdash;is backed up to the paired, secondary region. These backups are referred to as _geo-secondary backups_ that are set up during the time that the primary environment is deployed.

:::image type="content" source="media/bcdr.png" alt-text="Diagram illustrating a geo-secondary replica of data storage and compute infrastructure.":::

The above illustration shows that when primary Region A gets impacted during an outage, production type environments from Region A fail over to secondary Region B, which is healthy. No action is taken on other types of [environments](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview) such as default, Trial, sandbox, Teams, or developer.

To learn more about data protection in nonproduction environments, go toÂ [Back up and restore environments](/power-platform/admin/backup-restore-environments).

## How will you be notified of an outage?

The primary communications channel is via [Service Health Dashboard](/power-platform/admin/notifications-explained) (SHD) within Microsoft and Power Platform admin centers. The Microsoft communications team initiates the process by posting initial communications to notify you of the outage and post necessary updates to the SHD as needed. For more information on how to view your messages on the admin center, go to [Home page dashboard](/power-platform/admin/admin-documentation#home-page-dashboard). To be better prepared, visit the [readiness page](/services-hub/unified/health/ir-m365).Â Â Â Â 

## Failover and failback processes and criteria for business continuity

Failover and failback are the two main tasks accomplished during the business continuity and disaster recovery process. The purpose is to minimize the impact of a disaster on the availability and performance of critical business functions and applications.

**Failover** is the process of switching to a designated geo-secondary backup of all the systems and data from your primary production site. At the completion of the failover operation, your production environment is accessible from the geo-secondary site.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> While the finance and operations apps are operating in the secondary region after a failover maintenance, package deployments, financial reporting, and Power BI reporting are unavailable.

A **failback** operation is the process of returning production to its original location after a disaster or a scheduled maintenance period.

As part of Microsoft's business continuity and disaster recovery standard, customers can be ensured that each online service within Microsoft reviews, tests, and updates its BCDR plan annually. The Microsoft Cloud Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan Validation Report is available to customers onÂ [Service Trust Portal](https://aka.ms/stp).

If an unanticipated regionwide outage occurs, such as a natural disaster that affects the entire Azure region, the following steps and processes take place.

| Microsoft responsibilitiesÂ  | Customer responsibilitiesÂ  |
| --- | --- |
| If Microsoft detects an outage and sees customers being impacted, then Microsoft's communication team sends out the necessary communications and keeps the Service Health Dashboard up to date with the necessary information. | None |
| If an outage occurs, Microsoft performs an automatic failover of the **production instances** to the secondary region if there's *no data loss* to the customer. | None |
| If an outage occurs and Microsoft determines that there's *data loss*, then failing over the environment isn't initiated without customer consent/approval. | Once the customer is aware of the ongoing outage and sees *impact*, then it's the customer's responsibility: <br> - To reach out to Microsoft via support and find out the level of data loss that would occur if a failover is initiated. <br> - If the data loss is at an acceptable level to their organization standards, then customers should provide their **consent** via support for Microsoft to initiate a failover. |
| When Microsoft determines that the primary region is back online and is fully operational, a **failback** is performed on the production instances. There's no data loss during the planned failback process but users could experience brief interruptions or disconnects during this window. | None |

## Built-in disaster recovery

To ensure seamless disaster recovery, [Azure availability zones](/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview?tabs=azure-cli) provide built-in resilience for production environments without requiring manual intervention. Availability zones are distinct physical locations within an Azure region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking. Customer data is synchronously replicated across at least three availability zones, guaranteeing near zero replication lag and rapid recovery <mention something on the lines of RTO here>. If one zone experiences a failure, traffic is automatically rerouted to the remaining zones without service disruption.

In emerging micro-regions where multi-region setups may not be available, availability zones play a crucial role in maintaining resiliency. However, resilience is a shared responsibility. While Power Platform ensures failover, customers must also configure their Azure resources for zone redundancy to achieve end-to-end resilience.

## Self-service disaster recovery (preview)

[!INCLUDE [file-name](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-banner-section.md)]
[!INCLUDE [file-name](~/../shared-content/shared/preview-includes/preview-note-pp.md)]

Disaster recovery is a Power Platform premium infrastructure capability that allows customers to initiate environment failover between regions in a self-serve manner.

Customers typically have multiple environments of different types created in their tenant. This capability is available specifically for production-type, [Managed Environments](managed-environment-overview.md) and can be turned on for each environment. At this time, this capability isn't available for finance and operations production environments.

### Premium disaster recovery cost

Environments that activate premium disaster recovery, replicate all environment data between two regions and can failover between the regions. Replicated data of different storage types, such as Database, Log, and File are added to Dataverse capacity consumed (need Learn link to capacity onsumption) and billed at the same rate as the primary storage.

### Premium disaster recovery billing method

The environment must be linked to a [pay-as-you-go billing plan](pay-as-you-go-overview.md).

If your environment already uses a pay-as-you-go billing plan, then no further action is needed and replicated capacity is billed to your Azure subscription.

If your environment also draws capacity from tenant-licensed capacity entitlement, then entitled capacity is consumed first, but your pay-as-you-go billing plan is still required so you can avoid capacity overages. Learn how to allocate capacity and manage capacity overages through [pay-as-you-go billing plans](pay-as-you-go-set-up.md). 

### Turn on self-service disaster recovery

You need to turn on self-service disaster recovery for an environment before you can use the capability. This is a one-time action that provisions resources and starts the process of replicating data between the primary location and secondary location. This may take up to 48 hours to complete. Admins receive a notification when the process is complete. 

Turning on disaster recovery in an environment has no impact on the environment or the data within it.

To turn on disaster recovery, complete the following steps:

1. Navigate to the list of environments within the Power Platform admin center.
1. Select the production type environment where you want to turn on self-service disaster recovery.
1. Select **Disaster Recovery** in the command bar at the top of the page. The **Disaster Recovery** pane appears.
1. Select the toggle to change it to **Enabled**.
1. Select **Save**.
1. The environment is placed in the **Edit details** page briefly.
1. The **Environment details** page appears, indicating that the process of turning on the feature has started.

These two events may require you to use this feature: 
- Disaster recovery drill.
- Emergency response in the event of a major regional outage.
