# Use service admin roles to manage your tenant

To help you administer environments and settings for Microsoft Power Platform, you can assign users to manage at the tenant level without having to assign the more powerful Microsoft 365 global admin privilege.  

There are two Power Platform related service admin roles you can assign to provide a high level of admin management.

> [!NOTE]
> These ([and other](database-security.md#predefined-security-roles)) admin roles only apply to [what you can do in the Power Platform admin center](admin-documentation.md#power-platform-admin-center-capabilities). For example, Dynamics 365 Finance and Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management are currently not managed in the Power Platform admin center.

## Dynamics 365 administrator

The Dynamics 365 admin can:

- Sign in to and manage multiple environments. If an environment uses a security group, a service admin would need to be added to the security group in order to manage that environment. Not assigning to an in place security group essentially locks these admins out of any admin management. 
- Perform admin functions in Microsoft Power Platform because they have the System Administrator role.  

## Power Platform administrator 
  
 Users with the Power Platform admin role can:  
  
- Sign in to and manage multiple environments. Power Platform admins **are not affected** by security group membership and can manage environments even if not added to an environment's security group.
- Perform admin functions in Microsoft Power Platform because they have the System Administrator role.
  
Both service admin roles cannot do functions restricted to the Microsoft 365 global admin such as manage user accounts, manage subscriptions, access settings for Microsoft 365 apps like Microsoft Exchange or Microsoft SharePoint.  
  
## Assign a service admin role to a user

Follow these steps to assign a service admin role.

> [!NOTE]
> When the Dynamics 365 administrator, Power Platform administrator, or Global administrator role is assigend to a user in Microsoft Entra ID, the user will be assigned to the System administrator role in environments, as well. When the Dynamics 365 administrator, Power Platform administrator, or Global administrator role is removed in Microsoft Entra ID, user synchronization doesn't remove the System administrator role. So, even though this user is no longer a Dynamics 365 administrator, Power Platform administrator, or Global administrator in Microsoft Entra ID, the user still remains a System administrator in the tenant and will be able to see all environments. We recommend manually removing the System administrator role in all environments as soon as the role is removed from Microsoft Entra ID.
>
> To opt-out of automatic license-based user roles, see [Opt-out of automatic license-based user roles management](opt-out-automatic-license.md).

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/) as a global admin.

2. Go to **Users** > **Active users** and select a user.
  
3. Under **Account** > **Roles** select **Manage roles**.

4. Select to expand **Show all by category**.

5. Under **Collaboration** select either **Dynamics 365 administrator** or **Power Platform administrator**. 
  
6. Select **Save changes**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the [Microsoft Entra Privileged Identity Management (PIM)](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure#what-does-it-do) time-based role activation to manage your service admin roles, the service administrator permission is NOT removed from the environment when the time-based role activation expires.  
> 
> Service Admin roles must be assigned directly to users, as inheriting from security groups is not fully supported.

## Service administrator permission matrix

The following matrix shows what management is possible with the various service admin roles compared to the Microsoft 365 global admin role.

> [!NOTE]
> Global admin, Power Platform admin, and the Dynamics 365 admin roles must be directly assigned for a user. Role association through security groups is not supported.

<sup>1</sup>Equivalent permission level to a System Administrator. Has full permission to customize or administer the environment, including creating, modifying, and assigning security roles. Can view all data in the environment - if the user has a suitable license.

<sup>2</sup>If a security group is assigned to the environment and the user with this role added to the security group
