# View Intelligent recommendations about licensing

The **Intelligent recommendations** page provides you with recommendations about who in your organization would benefit from having a Power Apps premium license.

This feature allows Power Platform admins to assign licenses both directly and through security groups.

## Assign a Power Apps license
Complete the following steps to assign Power Apps premium licenses to users.

> [!Note]
>  Power Platform admins can assign users to the security groups that the admins own.   

1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).
   
2. In the navigation pane, select **Billing** > **Licenses**.

3. Select the **Intelligent recommendations** tab.

4. In the **Power Apps** web part, select **View + assign**. 

5. The **Ready to assign** pane appears. View the list of users who would benefit from having a license. You may want to filter the list to show users that meet the following criteria:

   - Users of Basic Power Apps licenses
   - Users who are in an active Power Apps trial
   - Users who have already requested a license from their admins
  
6. Specify who should get a license:
   - To assign licenses to specific users, select the checkmark next to the user's name. Then click **Continue**.
   - To assign licenses to all users, select **Continue**.

7. Indicate if you want to assign the licenses directly or through security groups.

8. Select the license you want to assign to the users. Click **Assign**.

## View recently assigned licenses
Near the bottom of the page, admins can see the history of license assignment, including a summary of users who were assigned licenses and the date of assignment.
