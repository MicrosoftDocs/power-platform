# Get recommendations about licensing (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The **Intelligent recommendations (Preview)** page provides you with recommendations about who in your organization would benefit from having a Power Apps license.

This feature allows admins to assign licenses both directly and through security groups.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren't meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - This feature is in process of rolling out, and may not be available in your region yet.

## Assign a Power Apps license
Complete the following steps to assign Power Apps licenses to users.

> [!Note}
>  Power Platform admins can assign users to the security groups that the admins own.   

1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).
   
2. In the navigation pane, select **Billing** > **Licenses**.

3. Select the **Intelligent recommendations (Preview)** tab.

4. In the **Power Apps** web part, select **View + assign**.

   - Users of Basic Power Apps licenses
   - Users who are in an active Power Apps trial
   - Users who have already requested a license from their admins
  
6. Specify who should get a license:
   - To assign licenses to specific users, select the checkmark next to the user's name. Then click **Continue**.
   - To assign licenses to all users, select **Continue**.

7. Indicate if you want to assign the licenses directly or through security groups.
