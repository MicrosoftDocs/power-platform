# Manage behavior settings 

Use Behavior settings to adjust how model-driven apps appear and function. These settings do not apply to canvas apps, except where noted.

These settings can be found in the Power Platform admin center by going to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Behavior**.

Make sure you have the System Administrator security role or equivalent permissions to update the business closures.

**Check your security role**

- Follow the steps in [View your user profile](/powerapps/user/view-your-user-profile).
- Don’t have the correct permissions? Contact your system administrator.

The 30-second period starts again after a change is made. If no changes are made, the automatic save doesn’t happen.

For firewall restrictions and IP approved list related issues, system administrators can select **Off** to disable the Azure Content Delivery Network feature. <br><br>**Note**: This setting does not apply to model-driven apps as they do not use CDN currently.|   On|
> |Share reassigned records with original owner|Select whether a record is shared with the original owner of the record, or completely reassigned to another user.|  Off |
> |Open in application mode|Select **On** to enable application mode. When this mode is enabled, customer engagement apps can be opened in a browser without menus, navigation, or toolbars. Hiding these parts of the browser causes customer engagement apps to appear like a separate application rather than a website. |  Off|

> |Full name display order|Select the order in which you want customer and user names to be displayed. |  First Name |
