# Manage behavior settings 

Use behavior settings to adjust how model-driven apps appear and function. These settings don't apply to canvas apps, except where noted.

Adjust the settings in the Power Platform admin center by going to **Environments** > _select an environment_ > **Settings** > **Product** > **Behavior**.

Make sure you have the System Administrator security role or equivalent permissions to update the collaboration settings. To check your security role, see [View your user profile](/powerapps/user/view-your-user-profile). If you don’t have the correct permissions, contact your system administrator.

## Release channel

|Settings|Description| Default value |
|--------------|-----------------|-----|  
|Model-driven app release channel|If this setting is set to **Semi-annual channel**, users in the organization use features from the _current release wave_, which is existing behavior. <br><br>If this setting is set to **Monthly channel**, users use features from the _current monthly release_. <br><br>This setting can be changed at any time and users are switched after one to two browser refreshes. Learn more at [Release channels for your model driven app](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/channel-overview).   | Auto<br><br>**Note**: Behavior for the **Auto** option is changing with 2024 release wave 2. Learn more at [Configuring release channel](/power-apps/maker/model-driven-apps/channel-overview#configuring-release-channel). | 

## Basic behavior

|Settings|Description| Default value |
|--------------|-----------------|-----|  
|Auto save|If **On**, after a record is created (initially saved), any changes made to a form are automatically saved 30 seconds after the change is made. The 30-second period starts again after a change is made. If no changes are made, the automatic save doesn’t happen. Learn more at [Manage auto-save](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/manage-auto-save).| On |
|Load default static content from Content Delivery Network| Canvas apps load out-of-the-box static content from the Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) service. For firewall restrictions and IP approved list related issues, system administrators can select **Off** to disable the Azure Content Delivery Network feature. <br><br>**Note**: This setting doesn't apply to model-driven apps as they don't use CDN currently.|   On|
|Share reassigned records with original owner|Select whether a record is shared with the original owner of the record, or reassigned to another user.|  Off |
|Open in application mode|Select **On** to enable application mode. When this mode is enabled, customer engagement apps can be opened in a browser without menus, navigation, or toolbars. Hiding these parts of the browser causes customer engagement apps to appear like a separate application rather than a website. |  Off|

## Formatting

|Settings|Description| Default value |
|--------------|-----------------|-----|  
|Full name display order|Select the order in which you want customer and user names to be displayed. |  First name |
|Display currencies using|Set how to display currencies, either by a currency symbol, which is the default setting, or by currency code. For example, a currency symbol could be $, and the currency code could be USD.|  Currency symbol | 
|Pricing decimal precision|Select how many decimal points to use for a currency.| 2|

## Display behavior

|Show the Switch to classic buttons in Power Apps| When **On**, makers are able to open and continue to use the deprecated, classic app view and form designers.  Learn more at [Classic app, form, and view designers are deprecated](../important-changes-coming.md#classic-app-form-and-view-designers-are-deprecated). |On |
|Show app download message|If **On**, users see a message regarding downloading the Dynamics 365 for tablets app.| On|
|Show legacy app to everyone, not just admins|The legacy web app, also known as *Dynamics 365 - custom*, is hidden from end users when a new environment is provisioned. It's always visible to those with System Administrator and System Customizer roles, and to other custom roles with similar privileges.  Learn more at [Dynamics 365 - custom (hidden for users)](enable-unified-interface-only.md#dynamics-365---custom-hidden-for-users).| Off | 
|Show legacy app for admins|Indicate if the legacy web app, also known as *Dynamics 365 - custom*, is hidden from System Administrator and System Customizer roles, and to other custom roles with similar privileges.

|--------------|-----------------|-----|  
|Minimum number of characters to trigger typeahead search  | Enter the minimum number of characters that trigger an automatic typeahead search in a lookup field in model-driven apps. <br><br>This setting can be used to improve lookup performance, particularly when the underlying environment database has huge amounts of data.  | Field is empty by default. |
| Delay between character inputs that trigger a search | Enter the delay interval in milliseconds that is introduced in lookups before a search is executed. <br><br> This can be used to improve lookup performance, particularly when the underlying environment database has huge amounts of data.   | 250 ms|
