# Enable OneDrive for Business (on-premises)

Users can create and manage private documents with [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)]. Those documents can be accessed within after the system administrator has enabled [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)].  
  
## Requirements  
 The following are required to use [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] with [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_2016_server](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-2016-server.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
> This topic applies to organizations deploying on-premises versions of [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] and customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), or an online/on-premises mix of these products. For information on integrating [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] online with customer engagement apps, see: [Enable OneDrive for Business](../admin/enable-onedrive-for-business.md).  
  
- [Set up SharePoint integration](../admin/set-up-sharepoint-integration.md) and have at least one team site.  
  
- Set up permission on the root [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] team site for all users who will use [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] in customer engagement apps. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Plan sites and manage users](https://support.office.com/article/Plan-sites-and-manage-users-95F9EB7A-4AC8-4DD5-A883-17686CBF8FFF)  
  
- For SharePoint on-premises, enable the Search service to access shared documents from other users. It is enabled by default on [!INCLUDE[pn_sharepoint_online](../includes/pn-sharepoint-online.md)] but not on [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] on-premises. [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [Create and configure a Search service application in SharePoint Server 2013](/SharePoint/search/create-and-configure-a-search-service-application)  
  
## Enable OneDrive for Business  
 You enable [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] as follows:  
  
1. In the Microsoft Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

2. Select **Settings** > **Integration** > **Document management settings**.   
  
3. Select **Enable OneDrive for Business** to enable it, and then select **OK**.  
  
   **If you're running [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)] on-premises**, on the Windows Server where [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_Server_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-server-short.md)] is running, open the [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] Management Shell and run the following commands to set up permissions between [!INCLUDE[pn_SharePoint_short](../includes/pn-sharepoint-short.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_2016_server](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-2016-server.md)].  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You might have already set up permissions and can skip the following if you completed the steps in [Configure server-based authentication with customer engagement apps and SharePoint on-premises](../admin/configure-server-based-authentication-sharepoint-on-premises.md).  
  
```powershell  
Add-Pssnapin *  
# Access WellKnown App principal  
[Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPWebService]::ContentService.WellKnownAppPrincipals  
  
# Create WellKnown App principal  
$ClientId = "00000007-0000-0000-c000-000000000000"  
$PermissionXml = "<AppPermissionRequests AllowAppOnlyPolicy=""true""><AppPermissionRequest Scope=""http://sharepoint/content/tenant"" Right=""FullControl"" /><AppPermissionRequest Scope=""http://sharepoint/social/tenant"" Right=""Read"" /><AppPermissionRequest Scope=""http://sharepoint/search"" Right=""QueryAsUserIgnoreAppPrincipal"" /></AppPermissionRequests>"  
  
$wellKnownApp= New-Object -TypeName "Microsoft.SharePoint.Administration.SPWellKnownAppPrincipal" -ArgumentList ($ClientId, $PermissionXml)  
  
$wellKnownApp.Update()  
  
```  
  
## Controlling access to OneDrive for Business 
 You can toggle availability of [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive](../includes/pn-onedrive.md)] for end users through the **OneDrive for Business** privilege.  

1. In the Power Platform admin center, select an environment. 

2. Select **Settings** > **Users + permissions** > **Security roles**.   

3. Choose a security role, and then select the **Core Records** tab.  
  
4. Under **Miscellaneous Privileges**, toggle the **OneDrive for Business** privilege to the desired availability.  
  
   > [!NOTE]
   >  This privilege is visible in the Security Roles dialog only after [!INCLUDE[pn_onedrive_for_business](../includes/pn-onedrive-for-business.md)] is enabled.
