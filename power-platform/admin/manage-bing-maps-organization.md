# Manage Bing Maps for your organization

Learn how you can manage [!INCLUDE[pn_bing_maps](../includes/pn-bing-maps.md)] for your entire organization. When [!INCLUDE[pn_bing_maps](../includes/pn-bing-maps.md)] is turned on, people see a map of a customer's location when they view contacts, leads, or accounts.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Customer Engagement (on-premises) organizations may need to enter a Bing Maps Enterprise Key to use the maps feature. Go to the [Bing Maps licensing page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=390116) for details on how to get a key.

## Turn Bing Maps on or off for your organization  
  
1. Browse to the Microsoft Power Platform admin center and sign in using administrator credentials.
  
2. Go to **Environments** > [select an environment] > **Settings** > **Product** > **Features**.

3. Under **Embedded content**,  turn on **Bing Maps**.
  
4. Select **Save**.  

## Languages and regions supported for viewing Bing Maps  

[!INCLUDE[pn_bing_maps](../includes/pn-bing-maps.md)] are not available in all countries, regions, or languages. When supported, the [!INCLUDE[pn_bing](../includes/pn-bing.md)] map is shown on the form, such as account, contact or lead, in your language. When unsupported, the map is not shown on the form. Instead, the link **Click here to view the map** is provided on the form. When you choose this link, you are taken directly to [!INCLUDE[pn_bing_maps](../includes/pn-bing-maps.md)].

You can configure the language in [Languages tab options](/powerapps/user/set-personal-options#languages-tab-options) and region in [Formats tab options](/powerapps/user/set-personal-options#formats-tab-options).
