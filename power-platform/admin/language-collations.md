# Microsoft Dataverse language collations

When an environment with a Dataverse database is created, admins are asked to select which default language they would like to use. This sets the dictionary, time and date
format, number format, and indexing properties for the environment.

Language selections for Dataverse also include collation settings that are applied to the SQL database, which stores tables and relational data. These collation settings affect things such as recognized characters, sorting, quick find, and filtering. The collations applied to environments are chosen based on the default language selected at the time of environment creation and aren't user configurable. After a collation is in place, it can't be changed.

Collations contain the following case-sensitivity and accent-sensitivity options that can vary from language to language.

|Case and accent option  |Collation  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Case insensitive     | _CI        | All languages have *case insensitive* enabled, which means that "Cafe" and "cafe" are considered the same word.        |
|Accent sensitive     | _AS        |  Some languages are *accent sensitive*, which means that "cafe" and "café" are treated as different words.       |
|Accent insensitive     | _AI        | Some languages are *accent insensitive*, which means that "cafe" and "café" are treated as the same word.        |


## Language details

A language includes the following information: 

- **LCID**: This is an identification number applied to languages in the Microsoft .NET framework to easily identify which language is being used. For example, 1033 is US English.

- **Language**: The actual language. In some cases, names, country, and character dataset information have been added for disambiguation.

- **Collation**: The language collation uses the case-sensitivity and accent-sensitivity options associated with the language (_CI, _AS, _AI) described earlier.
