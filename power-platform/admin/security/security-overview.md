# Security page overview

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

The **Security** page in the Power Platform admin center is designed to enhance your organization's security and streamline management. It provides a centralized location where you can view and manage security recommendations, assess your security score, and implement proactive policies to safeguard your organization.

Administrators can complete these tasks:

- **Assess your security score**: Use the security score to understand and improve your organization's security policies. The security score is shown on a qualitative scale (**Low**, **Medium**, or **High**). It helps you measure your organizational security position for Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 workloads.
- **Act on recommendations**: Identify and implement impactful recommendations that the system generates. These recommendations are based on best practices for improving a tenant's security score.
- **Manage proactive policies**: Manage proactive policies for governance and security.

## Prerequisite

To view your security score, you must turn on tenant-wide analytics. You can find instructions in [How do I enable tenant-level analytics?](../tenant-level-analytics.md#how-do-i-enable-tenant-level-analytics)

> [!NOTE]
> After you turn on tenant-wide analytics, it might take up to 24 hours for the **Security** page to be populated with data. Until then, most sections of the page show the message "Calculating security score."

## Access the Security page

To access the **Security** page, you must have Microsoft Entra ID roles such as Power Platform administrator or Dynamics 365 administrator. Learn more about these roles in [Use service admin roles to manage your tenant](../use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant.md). Environment administrators can manage security and compliance features for owned environments by opening the **Security** page as explained in the following procedure.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
1. In the navigation pane, select **Security**.
1. In the **Security** pane, select the page that you want to open. You can open pages for [data protection and privacy](data-protection-privacy.md), [identity and access management](identity-access-management.md), and [compliance](compliance.md).

> [!NOTE]
> - Only tenant administrators can access the scorecard and recommendations on the **Overview** page (**Security** \> **Overview**).
> - Only tenant administrators can convert an environment to a managed type.
> - On every security page, features that apply to Managed Environments are marked with the following meter symbol:

The security score is calculated based on the security features that are turned on in your environment. It provides a measurement of your organizational security position for Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 workloads.

- **Qualitative scale**: The security score is shown on a qualitative scale that uses three assessment labels:

    - **Low**: For scores from 0 through 50
    - **Medium**: For scores from 51 through 80
    - **High**: For scores from 81 through 100

    The more security features are turned on in your environment, the higher your security score. The **Medium** and **High** assessment labels indicate that more recommended actions were taken and led to an improvement in the security position of the tenant.

- **Feature impact**: Each security feature is assigned a score, based on the feature's scope and the number of resources that are affected by turning it on or off. As new security features are added, the total possible score might change. Therefore, your overall score might be affected even if your settings remain the same.
- **Score calculation formula**: The security score is expressed as a percentage and is calculated by using the following formula:

    (*Your score* &divide; *Total possible score*) &times; 100

For example, your tenant has 10 environments, five Managed Environments and five non-Managed Environments. The following features are configured:

- **IP firewall**: Turned on in two of the 10 environments (2 points).
- **Tenant isolation**: Turned on in all 10 environments (10 points).
- **Environment security group**: Turned on in five of the 10 environments (5 points).

In this case, your total score is 2 &plus; 10 &plus; 5 = 17, and the total possible score is 30. Therefore, your security score is (17 &divide; 30) &times; 100 = 56.66%.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - The security score is updated every 24 hours. Therefore, any action that is taken might take up to 24 hours to reflect the updated score.
> - The score calculation considers all environments, both Managed Environments and non-Managed Environments.
> - If there are no Managed Environments that you can take action on in the recommendation pane, no environments are listed.

## Reactive governance through recommendations

The system generates various recommendations, based on common best practices that improve the security score of your tenant. Recommendations refer to actions or measures that the administrator can take to enhance the overall security status.

- Administrators are guided through an intuitive experience where they take relevant actions on environments, based on specific recommendations.
- Each recommendation shows the potential increase to the overall security score.

Although the recommendations span all environments, you can act on them only in Managed Environments. In the case of non-Managed Environments, you can turn on recommended features by opening the **Settings** page, finding the required feature, and turning it on for those environments.

## Conditions that trigger feature recommendations

The following table outlines the conditions that trigger specific feature recommendations.

| Feature | Scope | Condition that triggers recommendations |
|---------|-------|-----------------------------------------|
| Administrator privileges | Environment | Environments that have more than 10 administrators |
| Auditing | Environment | Environments where auditing is turned off |
| Customer Lockbox | Tenant | Tenants where Customer Lockbox is turned on, but that have no Managed Environments |
| Client application access control | Environment | Environments where auditing is turned on and client application access control isn't configured |
| Data policy | Tenant | No tenant-level policy is set. |
| Environments Azure Virtual Network | Environment | Environments that have no Virtual Network policy |
| Environment security group | Environment | Environments that have no security group |
| Guest access | Environment | Environments where restricted guest access is turned off |
| IP firewall | Environment | Environments where IP firewall isn't configured |
| IP address-based cookie binding | Environment | Environments where IP address-based cookie binding isn't configured |
| Sharing | Environment | Environments that have no sharing limit |
| Tenant isolation | Tenant | The tenant isolation setting is turned off. |

## Manage proactive policies for governance and security

Several security features are available to help secure your tenant. For some of these features, a Managed Environment is a prerequisite. Therefore, before you can configure such a feature, you're asked to convert the environment to a managed type if it isn't one.

Use the following links to view and manage proactive policies for governance and security:

- [Data protection and privacy](data-protection-privacy.md): Ensure that personal information is securely handled, stored, and protected; prevent unauthorized access to data; and protect apps and cloud workloads from network-based cyberattacks through features such as [customer-managed keys](../customer-managed-key.md), data policies, and Azure Virtual Network.
- [Identity and access management](identity-access-management.md): Ensure that authorized users are the only people who can access sensitive data in items across the tenant, through features such as IP firewall, IP address-based cookie binding, tenant isolation, environment security groups, sharing controls, and guest access.
- [Compliance](compliance.md): Implement robust compliance measures to safeguard organizational data and ensure adherence to industry regulations, through features such [Customer Lockbox](../about-lockbox.md) and auditing.

## Dismiss recommendations
We understand that security management isnâ€™t one-size-fits-all. Some recommendations may already be mitigated through alternative solutions, but until now, admins had no way to reflect these changes leading to a security score that remained stagnant.With dismiss recommendations, admins can now mark specific recommendations as dismissed through an alternate solution. Once dismissed, these recommendations will no longer impact your security score, allowing you to gain the points associated with them.Your dismissed recommendations are always accessible, meaning you can review their history at any time. If circumstances change or you wish to revisit a previously dismissed recommendation, you can easily reactivate it to ensure continuous security optimization.

## Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

### How is the security score calculated?

The security score is calculated based on the security features that are turned on in your environment. Each security feature is assigned a score, based on the feature's scope and the number of resources that are affected by turning it on or off. It's important to note that the total possible score might change as new security features are added. Therefore, your overall security score might be affected even if your settings remain the same.

### Why don't all environments appear in the recommended action?

Although the recommendations span all environments, you can act on them only in Managed Environments. In the case of non-Managed Environments, you can turn on recommended features by opening the **Settings** page, finding the required feature, and turning it on for those environments.

### Can customers modify the recommendations based on their needs?

No. The recommendations are system-generated and are based on Microsoft best practices and guidance.

### When can the security score be updated after I take recommended actions?

After you take action to turn on the feature, it might take up to 24 hours to reflect the overall security score. The security score isn't updated in real time.

### Why don't administrator privileges work for environment administrators, such as the System Administrator role?

This issue is a known limitation. Only tenant administrators can manage the administrator privileges.
