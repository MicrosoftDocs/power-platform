# Use compliance features
                                                  
Compliance is essential in safeguarding organizational data and ensuring adherence to industry regulations. Implementing robust compliance measures helps mitigate risks and maintain trust with stakeholders.

Auditing log changes are made to customer records in an environment with a Dataverse database. Dataverse auditing also logs user access through an app or through the SDK in an environment. Learn more in [Manage Dataverse auditing](../manage-dataverse-auditing.md).

## Customer Lockbox
This feature applies to Managed Environments only. Customer Lockbox provides an interface for customers to review and approve (or reject) data access requests on the rare occasions when access to customer data is needed. It's used in cases where a Microsoft engineer needs to access customer data, in response to a customer-initiated support ticket, or a problem identified by Microsoft. Learn more in [Securely access customer data using Customer Lockbox in Power Platform and Dynamics 365](../about-lockbox.md).
