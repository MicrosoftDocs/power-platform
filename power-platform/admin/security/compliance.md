# Use compliance features
                                                  
Compliance is essential in safeguarding organizational data and ensuring adherence to industry regulations. Implementing robust compliance measures helps mitigate risks and maintain trust with stakeholders.

## Customer Lockbox
This feature applies to Managed Environments only. Customer Lockbox provides an interface for customers to review and approve (or reject) data access requests on the rare occasions when access to customer data is needed. It's used in cases where a Microsoft engineer needs to access customer data, in response to a customer-initiated support ticket, or a problem identified by Microsoft. Learn more in [Securely access customer data using Customer Lockbox in Power Platform and Dynamics 365](../about-lockbox.md).
  
## Customer-managed encryption key
This feature applies to Managed Environments only. This feature allows customers to manage the key that encrypts Power Platform and Dynamics 365 data, preventing outside access to customer data and meeting data protection requirements. Learn more in [Manage your customer-managed encryption key](../customer-managed-key.md).
