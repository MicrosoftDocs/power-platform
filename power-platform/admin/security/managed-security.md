# Managed security

[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

In today's AI-driven world, it's more critical than ever that you safeguard your enterprise data and business processes. Managed security provides comprehensive solutions to protect your data from threats, control access, prevent data exfiltration, and gain visibility into your security posture. It also helps assess risks and ensure compliance with various regulations. These capabilities make it a robust tool for today's cybersecurity challenges.

## What can you do with managed security?

Managed security is a suite of premium capabilities that offers advanced protection and empowers security administrators to effectively manage and secure access to customer data and resources. It brings together Microsoft's most advanced threat protection, data protection and privacy, identity and access management, and compliance capabilities to help customers meet today's cybersecurity challenges.

Managed security encompasses, but isn't limited to, the following capabilities:

- **Compliance**: Implement robust compliance measures to safeguard organizational data and ensure adherence to industry regulations through features such as [Customer Lockbox](../about-lockbox.md).
- **Data protection and privacy**: Ensure that personal information is securely handled, stored, and protected in a way that maintains confidentiality and integrity and prevents unauthorized access. Features such as [Azure Virtual Network](../vnet-support-overview.md), [customer-managed keys](../customer-managed-key.md), [data policies](../managed-environment-data-policies.md), [data masking](../create-manage-masking-rules.md), and [Microsoft Purview Data Map](/purview/register-scan-dataverse?) help protect applications and cloud workloads from network-based cyberattacks.
- **Identity and access management**: Ensure that only authorized users can access specific resources, through features such as [IP firewall](../ip-firewall.md), [IP cookie binding](../block-cookie-replay-attack.md), [Manage sharing](../managed-environment-sharing-limits.md), [conditional access policies for individual apps](/power-platform-release-plan/2022wave1/power-apps/conditional-access-policies-individual-power-apps), [managed identities for Dataverse plug-ins](../managed-identity-overview.md), and [privileged access](access-control.md).
- **Threat protection**: Protect your organization's assets and resources through unified detection by using [Microsoft Sentinel solution for Power Platform](/azure/sentinel/business-applications/power-platform-solution-overview). This solution allows for intelligent detection and responses to suspicious activities, such as mass data deletion or unauthorized app execution. In this way, it enhances your security posture and effectively mitigates potential threats.
- **Security posture management**: Detect security risks through tailored recommendations and clear guidance about how to take action on individual environments or manage security at scale through group policies.
