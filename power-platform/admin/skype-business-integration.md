# Skype for Business and Skype integration

If your organization uses [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] (formerly known as [!INCLUDE[pn_Microsoft_Lync](../includes/pn-microsoft-lync.md)]) or [!INCLUDE[pn_skype](../includes/pn-skype.md)], you can take advantage of connectivity features like click-to-call or checking user availability from within model-driven apps in Dynamics 365, such as Dynamics 365 Sales and Customer Service, or [!INCLUDE[pn_microsoft_dynamics_crm_for_outlook](../includes/pn-microsoft-dynamics-crm-for-outlook.md)].

## Using Skype for Business with model-driven apps in Dynamics 365

 When you use [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] and Dynamics 365 apps together, you can use [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)]) presence and click-to-call from within Dynamics 365 apps.  
  
 Your organization must have a Skype for Business Online license.
  
  **Client requirements and configuration**  
  
- To use click-to-call, [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] must be selected as the telephony provider. You can set this by selecting an environment in the Power Platform admin center, and then select **Settings** > **Product** > **Features**. Under **Communications** review the Skype settings.  
  
- By default, [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] presence is enabled in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365. System administrators can enable or disable presence in model-driven apps in Dynamics 365. To do this, set **Skype presence** to **On** or **Off**.  
  
- Each user must have the [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] client installed and running on their PC.  
  
- For [!INCLUDE[pn_skype_for_business](../includes/pn-skype-for-business.md)] presence, users must have `https://*.dynamics.com` added to their web browsers trusted sites list in Internet options in [!INCLUDE[pn_Internet_Explorer](../includes/pn-internet-explorer.md)].
