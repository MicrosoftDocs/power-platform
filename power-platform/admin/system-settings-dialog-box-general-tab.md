If you disable social engagement, your organization will not be able to receive social data. Users can continue to work with existing social data, however.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| For compatibility, use the legacy form rendering engine. Note that performance may be adversely affected. | In [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_online_2015_update_1_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-online-2015-update-1-shortest.md)] and [!INCLUDE[pn_crm_2016_shortest](../includes/pn-crm-2016-shortest.md)] on-premises, we made enhancements to forms so that they load faster.<br /><br /> However, if you have forms that include unsupported customizations, these enhancements can cause compatibility problems. To avoid this, you can temporarily turn the form enhancements off by choosing **Yes**. We recommend that you reset this setting to **No** after addressing scripting problems so you can take advantage of optimized forms. **Note:**  When a form that includes unsupported customizations is used, such as unsupported [!INCLUDE[pn_JavaScript](../includes/pn-javascript.md)], the form may fail to load or the user will receive an error message. <ul><li>If the form just fails, set the **Use legacy form rendering** option to **Yes**. If the form loads after you select this option, you may have unsupported customizations.</li><li>If the user receives an error, click "View the data that will be sent to Microsoft" and see the details in the \<CrmScriptErrorReport> tags. <!-- [!INCLUDE[proc_more_information](../includes/proc-more-information.md)] [What kinds of customizations aren't supported?](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/customize/customization-concepts.md#what-kinds-of-customizations-arent-supported)--></li></ul> |
