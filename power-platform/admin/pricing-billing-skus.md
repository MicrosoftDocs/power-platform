# Licensing overview for Power Platform

The topics in this section provide detailed information about Power Apps and Microsoft Power Automate licensing.

For information about Power BI licensing, see [Power BI Pricing](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/).

## Power Apps/Power Automate for Microsoft 365

Power Apps/Power Automate capabilities for Microsoft 365 enable users to extend and
customize the Office experience with Power Apps and Power Automate. Users can
create applications and flows based on Microsoft 365 data. These productivity apps
can also utilize data outside of Microsoft 365 by connecting to common services
including Box.com, Facebook, and many more via the use of standard connectors.

Here is a brief overview of capabilities included with Power Apps for Microsoft 365
plan. More details around which Microsoft 365 plans include these capabilities can be
found in [Microsoft Power Apps and Power Automate Licensing
Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130)
