# About Microsoft Cloud France  

As of July 2019, Microsoft Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation), Finance and Supply Chain Management, Power Apps, and Power Automate are available in Franceâ€™s datacenters. This new deployment option serves customers in regulated industry and commercial organizations that do business with tables in France that require local data residency. Power BI has been available since March 2019.

The deployment of the Microsoft Dataverse services in France is built upon the foundational principles of security, privacy, compliance, transparency, and reliability, which offers French organizations a complete cloud infrastructure and platform, as well as familiar productivity and business application tools. This means that customer data stays resident within France.

Microsoft strives to maintain functional parity between our commercially available service and Power Platform and Dynamics 365 apps offerings in France. However, there are few exceptions affected by dependent service or partner-solution availability, market priorities, or compliance regulations. For more information about these exceptions or for questions about services in France, contact [Microsoft Dynamics Online support](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/support/).
