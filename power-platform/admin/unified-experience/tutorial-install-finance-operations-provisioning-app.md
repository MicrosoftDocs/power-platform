# Tutorial: Install the Finance and Operations Provisioning app 

Finance and operations apps are reimagined as an application hosted by Microsoft Dataverse. Customers don't need to provision their enterprise resource planning (ERP) system separately from their low-code and other Dynamics 365 platform applications. Most administrative actions in Power Platform are available through the admin center and an API-based experience.

In this tutorial, learn how to:

- Locate an existing environment in the Power Platform admin center with other Dynamics 365 apps installed.
- Install the Finance and Operations Provisioning app to see finance and operations apps capabilities.

For example, a customer who already purchased other Dynamics 365 apps wants to add finance and operations apps capabilities to one of their existing environments.

## Prerequisites
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a user tries to install the **Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Provisioning app** on a Dataverse organization that is already linked to an Lifecylce Services (LCS) managed environment, the app installation fails. This application should only be used while provisioning a new unified environment.

- You must have a license to install finance and operations apps in Power Platform.

    Example licenses:

    - Dynamics 365 Finance
    - Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management for customers
    - Dynamics 365 Operations Application Partner Sandbox for partners and ISVs

- Your license administrator must assign the license to your user account in Microsoft Entra. You can review the licenses currently assigned to you from the [Subscriptions](https://portal.office.com/account/?ref=MeControl#subscriptions) page.
- Have at least 1 GB of available Operations and Dataverse database capacities. For more information, see [Manage storage and capacity](../finance-operations-storage-capacity.md).
- You must use an environment where the **Enable Dynamics 365 apps** option was turned on when the environment is created. This option is a prerequisite for all Dynamics 365 apps, including Sales, Customer Service, Field Service, and all finance and operations apps.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you try to install without turning on the **Enable Dynamics 365 apps** option, you receive an error message that says, _Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Provisioning App isn't supported on SchemaType: Standard_. The schema isn't a visible property in the Power Platform admin center and can't be changed after the environment is created. You can try to install finance and operations apps in another environment, or you can [create an environment by using an ERP template](./tutorial-deploy-new-environment-with-ERP-template.md).  
    

- You must install the platform tools app before you install the provisioning app. Detailed steps are given in the [Install on an environment](#install-on-an-environment) section.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > If you don't install the platform tools app first, you receive an error such as "Please install the Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Platform Tools application before installing the Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations Provisioning app." You can install the missing app and then retry the installation of the provisioning app.

## Known limitations

Installation of the provisioning app has the following known limitations:
- **Reusing the domain of a deleted environment**: The environment, domain name for a unified environment isn't reusable for up to 7 days from when the environment was deleted.
- **Environment URL length**: The hostname of your Dataverse environment URL must be less than or equal to 19 characters in length. Otherwise, installation of the Finance and Operations Provisioning app fails. To bypass this limitation, edit the URL of your environment so that it's the required length.
- **Finance and operations URL missing**: After the installation is successful, the finance and operations URL might not be shown on the environment details page in the Power Platform admin center. To bypass this limitation, edit the environment, and change a field such as **Description** to a new value. This edit operation synchronizes the new URL value and shows it on the screen.

## Step-by-step installation guide

### Install on an environment

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com).

Then select **Next**.
