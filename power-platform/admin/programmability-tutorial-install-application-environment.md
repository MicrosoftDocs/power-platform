# Tutorial: Install an application to a target environment (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

This tutorial is aimed at enabling Power Platform admins so they can take advantage of the Power Platform API to install Applications of which their tenant already has entitlement. These applications should be visible in the Power Platform admin center under **Environments** > ***[environment-name]*** > **Resources** > **Dynamics 365 apps**. 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:

1.	Create a Power Automate or Logic Apps workflow (Azure) that authenticates with Power Platform API. 
2.	Call the Get Environment Application Package API to retrieve the list of Applications you can install to a specific environment 
3.	Install the Application using Install Application Package API
4.	Poll for status of the Install Operation Get Application Package Install Status API
5.	Notify by email once install is complete

In this example scenario, a Customer is looking to install Office Groups to a specific environment of their choosing. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Power Platform API is in preview. The host name and data contracts are subject to change by the time the endpoints become generally available.  At that time, this article will be updated with the final endpoint details.

## Choose a tool that can authenticate with Power Platform API
Below are details on getting connected to the Power Platform programmatically.  This tutorial includes using Azure Logic Apps as a common client for admins working in the Azure space, and a native Power Platform CLI example.

# [Azure](#tab/Azure)
### Create the workflow and set up the variables
To start off, in this tutorial we'll use a Logic Apps workflow.  A Power Automate flow is also acceptable, and any other orchestration engine that your company prefers to use for automation.  All of the calls to retrieve the data will be using RESTful APIs so any tooling that supports REST will work with this tutorial.

Visit the Azure portal, and then create a new logic app and give it a name:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Create a logic app.](media/appmgmt-tutorial-1.png "Create a logic app (Azure)")

After that finishes provisioning, edit the workflow using the Designer and set up a Recurrence trigger to run on schedule of your choosing:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Set up a Recurrence trigger.](media/capacity2.png "Set up a Recurrence trigger")

For the remainder of this tutorial, you'll need an environment ID and an application name to complete the subsequent steps:
- **Environment Id**: The ID of the environment to which you would install the package. This isn't the organization ID.
- **Application name**: The name of the application you're trying to install.

Next we'll authenticate with Microsoft Microsoft Entra and retrieve a token for calling the Power Platform API.  If you haven’t completed your Microsoft Entra setup, see [Authentication (preview)](programmability-authentication-v2.md).

In this tutorial, we're using a user credential with password to obtain a token.  An example call to Microsoft Entra ID is below:

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Authenticate with Microsoft Entra and retrieve a token for calling the Power Platform API.](media/appmgmt-tutorial-2.png "Authenticate with Microsoft Entra and retrieve a token for calling the Power Platform API")

We then parse the Microsoft Entra token response into a typed object using this JSON schema in the 'Parse JSON' action:

```json
{
    "properties": {
        "access_token": {
            "type": "string"
        },
        "expires_in": {
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "ext_expires_in": {
            "type": "integer"
        },
        "token_type": {
            "type": "string"
        }
    },
    "type": "object"
}
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Parse the Microsoft Entra token response into a strongly typed object.](media/capacity5.png "Parse the Microsoft Entra token response into a strongly typed object")

# [Power Platform CLI](#tab/pacCLI)
### Get authenticated
Using Power Platform CLI, you can easily get authenticated with a particular Dataverse organization.  To do this, select an existing auth profile:
```cmd
pac auth select --name "NameOfProfile"
```
> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Select an auth profile.](media/appmgmt-tutorial-cli-1.png "Select an auth profile")

For more information, see the [Auth](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/cli/reference/auth-command) article for more in depth examples.

## Retrieve available packages to install
In this section, we'll retrieve the list of Applications you can install to a specific environment.  Be sure to have your **environment Id** available, and that this environment has a Dataverse database created.

# [Azure](#tab/Azure)

### Environment Application Package endpoint
Now we'll make our first call to the Power Platform API.  We’ll use the [Get Environment Application Package API](/rest/api/power-platform/appmanagement/applications/get-environment-application-package) to retrieve all of the available packages we can install for the given Dataverse organization. Be sure that the identity you're using, be it a Service Principal or a username/password, has access to Dataverse and the appropriate security role.

```http
GET https://api.powerplatform.com/appmanagement/environments/{environmentId}/applicationPackages?api-version=2022-03-01-preview
```

We then parse the response into a strongly typed object using this JSON schema with the 'Parse JSON' action:
```json

    "properties": {
        "value": {
            "items": {

# [Power Platform CLI](#tab/pacCLI)
### List the applications for the environment
Now we can make use of the application verb and list out the available applications that this environment has entitlement to install.

```cmd
pac application list --environment-id "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID_HERE"
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![List the apps for an environment.](media/appmgmt-tutorial-cli-2.png "List the apps for an environment")

For more information, see the [Auth](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/cli/reference/application-command) article for more in depth examples.

---

## Install the application
Now we can take one of the applications from the prior step and install it.  Let's say you would like to install the "Office 365 Groups" application. Select the value in the PackageUniqueName field, in this case, it's Office365Groups to utilize in the next step.

# [Azure](#tab/Azure)

### Install application API

We'll make use of the [Install application API](/rest/api/power-platform/appmanagement/applications/install-application-package) endpoint to trigger the installation. Be sure to set the **uniqueName** property to Office365Groups in this example. 

```http
POST https://api.powerplatform.com/appmanagement/environments/{environmentId}/applicationPackages/{uniqueName}/install?api-version=2022-03-01-preview
```

And the request body will have the application entry from the earlier step:
```json
{
                "id": "ce3bab3c-ada1-40cf-b84b-49b26603a281",
                "uniqueName": "Office365Groups",
                "version": "2.9.0.3",
                "localizedDescription": "With Office 365 groups, you can collaborate with people across your company even if they aren’t Dynamics 365 users. Groups provide a single location to share conversations, meetings, documents, and more.",
                "localizedName": "Office 365 Groups",
                "applicationId": "2f17f077-4175-4d82-b82b-17cd8950b74f",
                "applicationName": "Office365Groups",
                "applicationDescription": "",
                "singlePageApplicationUrl": "",
                "publisherName": "Microsoft CRM Package",
                "publisherId": "255953fd-9ab8-4146-bfa1-859aae326ae9",
                "learnMoreUrl": "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525719",
                "crmMinversion": "8.0",
                "crmMaxVersion": null,
                "customHandleUpgrade": false,
                "instancePackageId": null,
                "state": "None",
                "catalogVisibility": "None",
                "applicationVisibility": "All",
                "errorDetails": null,
                "startDateUtc": "2016-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "endDateUtc": "2050-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "supportedCountries": [
                    "AE",
                    "AL",
                    "AM",
                    "AO",
                    "VN",
                    "ZA",
                    "ZW"
                ]
            }
```

The following is an example response:
```json
{
        "id": "9a44d33b-6055-4c9b-aa4a-4c410a22e9ad",

        "applicationDescription": "",
        "singlePageApplicationUrl": "",
        "publisherName": "Microsoft CRM Package",
        "publisherId": "255953fd-9ab8-4146-bfa1-859aae326ae9",
        "packageUniqueName": "Office365Groups",
        "packageVersion": "2.9.0.3",
        "localizedDescription": "With Office 365 groups, you can collaborate with people across your company even if they aren’t Dynamics 365 users. Groups provide a single location to share conversations, meetings, documents, and more.",
        "localizedName": "Office 365 Groups",
        "learnMoreUrl": "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=525719",
        "termsOfServiceBlobUris": [
            "https://crmprodnam.blob.core.windows.net/preferredsolution/microsoft_tos_dbd53f75-b571-46ad-b9ce-21b5656b85dd_1?sv=2018-03-28&sr=c&sig=v5iBtDum0N6A0sqyyhIkPECibmpGOKGiSmmm3ALGIR0%3D&se=2022-03-23T19%3A35%3A59Z&sp=r"
        ],
        "applicationVisibility": "All",
        "lastOperation": {
            "state": "InstallRequested",
            "createdOn": "2022-03-22T19:35:59.7425066Z",
            "modifiedOn": null,
            "errorDetails": null,
            "statusMessage": null,
            "instancePackageId": "9a44d33b-6055-4c9b-aa4a-4c410a22e9ad",
            "operationId": "4fde996a-bf68-413c-b2bf-33f21a7e9afb"
        },
        "customHandleUpgrade": false
    }
```

Then we'll use the Parse JSON action to get the operationID for our subsequent steps.

# [Power Platform CLI](#tab/pacCLI)
### Trigger installation
Now we can make use of the application verb and install an app from the output of the prior step.

```cmd
pac application install --environment-id "YOUR_ENVIRONMENT_ID_HERE" --application-name "APP_UNIQUE_NAME_HERE"
```

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Trigger install.](media/appmgmt-tutorial-cli-3.png "Trigger install")

For more information, see the [Auth](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/cli/reference/application-command) article for more in depth examples.

## Poll for operation status
Now we'll monitor progress of the application install by polling every so often using the operationID from the prior step.

# [Azure](#tab/Azure)

### Use the Until control
By evaluating the response from polling the OperationID for anything terminal status such as *Canceled*, *Failed*, or *Succeeded* we'll effectively monitor for the process to complete.  This is done easily with the Until control, which will loop continuously until this condition is met.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Until control.](media/appmgmt-tutorial-3.png "Until control")

We'll make use of the [Application Install Status](/rest/api/power-platform/appmanagement/applications/get-application-package-install-status) endpoint to monitor the installation. Be sure to set the **operationId** property to from the prior step. 

```http
GET https://api.powerplatform.com/appmanagement/environments/{environmentId}/operations/{operationId}?api-version=2022-03-01-preview
```

An example output is shown below:
```json
{
  "status": "NotStarted",
  "createdDateTime": "2022-03-22T20:05:58.9414573Z",
  "lastActionDateTime": null,
  "error": null,
  "statusMessage": null,
  "operationId": "523b51a8-6af4-40cd-aa7d-86bddfa6697b"
}
```

From here, we can evaluate the status and if it's one of the terminal values we can break the loop.

### Send an email
Now that the monitoring has concluded, we can share the result over email as an example activity.

> [!div class="mx-imgBorder"] 
> ![Send an email (v2) on the status of the activity.](media/appmgmt-tutorial-4.png "Send an email (v2) on the status of the activity")

# [Power Platform CLI](#tab/pacCLI)
### Monitor progress
Congratulations! You've reached the easy part, now just sit back and watch as your application completes installation.  In the case of a failure, you can always review the detailed logs from the Dynamics 365 apps list in your environment in the Power Platform admin center.
