# Solution checker enforcement in Managed Environments (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can use [solution checker](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/use-powerapps-checker) in Managed Environments to enforce rich static analysis checks on your solutions against a set of best practice rules and identify problematic patterns.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - This is a preview feature.
> - Preview features aren’t meant for production use and may have restricted functionality. These features are available before an official release so that customers can get early access and provide feedback.
> - This feature is being gradually rolled out across regions and might not be available yet in your region.

To enable solution checker enforcement for your Managed Environment:

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac).
1. In the navigation pane, select **Environments**, and then select a managed environment.
1. On the command bar, select **Edit Managed Environments**, and then select the appropriate setting under **Solution checker enforcement**.

## Solution checker settings

Select one of the following settings:

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| None |  Turns off the automatic solution validations during solution import. There aren't any experience or behavioral changes to solution authoring, exports, or imports. |
| Warn |  All custom solutions are automatically verified during solution import. When a solution with highly-critical issues is being imported, you are warned about the action but the import itself continues, and if everything else with the import is fine, the solution is imported into the environment. After a successful import, a message stating that the imported solution had validation issues is shown. Additionally, Power Platform environment admins receive a summary email with details of the solution validation. |
| Block | All custom solutions are automatically verified during solution import. When a solution has highly-critical issues, the import process is canceled, and a message stating that the imported solution had validation issues is shown. This happens before the actual import, so there aren't any changes to the environment due to the import failure. Additionally, Power Platform environment admins receive a summary email with details of the solution validation.|

When the solution checker enforcement is turned on, all solutions should be validated explicitly using the solution checker in the source environment before importing into a target environment. Without this step, the verification of solutions fails and in the **Block** mode, solution imports are blocked.

For more information on what to do when encountering a warn or block, see the [troubleshooting guide](/troubleshoot/power-platform/power-apps/manage-apps-and-solutions/solution-checker-enforcement-import-issues).

## Email messages to the admin

When the validation mode is set to **Warn** or **Block**, Power Platform admins receive summary emails when a solution is imported or blocked. When the solution is imported into an environment, environment admins can see the count of issues by severity in the solution in the summary email.

The email is sent to all users with the roles of [Power Platform administrator](use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant.md#power-platform-administrator) and [Dynamics 365 service administrator](use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant.md#dynamics-365-administrator). It is also sent to recipients of the [weekly digest emails](managed-environment-usage-insights.md#who-can-receive-the-weekly-digest).

### Suppress validation emails

By default, emails are sent when a solution fails validation for medium and above severities. When the checkbox is selected, emails aren't sent in warn mode. Emails aren't sent in block mode, as well, except for critical violations which block solution import.

### Use PowerShell to enable solution checker enforcement

You can use PowerShell to enable solution checker enforcement.

#### Enable solution checker enforcement in block mode

Here's an example PowerShell script that enables solution checker enforcement in block mode. After you run it, the slider shows block mode in the **Solution checker** section of the Managed Environments settings.

```powershell
SetManagedEnvironmentSolutionCheckerEnforcementLevel -EnvironmentId 8d996ece-8558-4c4e-b459-a51b3beafdb4 -Level block
```

#### Enable solution checker enforcement in warn mode

Here's an example PowerShell script that enables solution checker enforcement in warn mode. After you run it, the slider shows warn mode in the **Solution checker** section of the Managed Environments settings.

```powershell
SetManagedEnvironmentSolutionCheckerEnforcementLevel -EnvironmentId 8d996ece-8558-4c4e-b459-a51b3beafdb4 -Level warn
```

#### Turn off solution checker enforcement

Here's an example PowerShell script that turns off solution checker enforcement. After you run it, the slider shows **Off** in the **Solution checker** section of the Managed Environments settings.

```powershell
SetManagedEnvironmentSolutionCheckerEnforcementLevel -EnvironmentId 8d996ece-8558-4c4e-b459-a51b3beafdb4 -Level none
```
