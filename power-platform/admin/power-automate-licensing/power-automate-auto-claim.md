# Auto-claim policies for Power Automate licenses

As an administrator, you traditionally assign licenses to users _manually_. [Auto-claim for Power Automate licenses](/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/manage-auto-claim-policies) allows administrators to easily set up policies in the Microsoft 365 admin center, similar to other Microsoft products and services. Once a policy is configured, any user in the organization who requires an individual Power Automate user license is automatically assigned a license.

You can create and manage these auto-claim policies in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2259913).

## Auto-claim policies scope

The current scope of Power Automate license auto-claim policy applies to the following licenses:

- Power Automate premium plan
- Power Automate per user plan (legacy)

When the auto-claim policy is configured, the following scenarios automatically assign a license to a user when the user lacks the required entitlement.

### Power Automate per user plan

In the Power Automate portal:

- User triggers / saves / turns on a premium cloud flow (or standard flow for managed environments)
- User requests the Power Automate per user license

### Power Automate premium

In addition to the scenarios listed for the [Power Automate per user plan](#power-automate-per-user-plan), users perform these tasks.

In the Power Automate portal:

- User triggers / saves / turns on a premium cloud flow with attended RPA (Robotic Process Automation)
- User requests the Power Automate premium license

In the Power Automate for desktop application (installer version 2.43 or later version):

- User selects **Go Premium**
- User has a self-assisted premium trial and is actively using RPA capabilities

## View license assignment in auto-claim policy report

The auto-claim policy report displays all license assignments from the auto-claim policy in the last 90 days.

To view the auto-claim policy report:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Billing** > **Licenses**, and then select the **Auto-claim policy** tab.
1. Select **View report**. The Auto-claim policy report page lists all licenses assigned from each policy in the last number of days. By default, the page shows the past 90 days.

To change the time period shown, select the **Past 30 days** dropdown list. You can view reports for the past 1, 7, 30, and 90 days.

## Auto-claim policy enabled by default

To simplify license management for administrators, auto-claim policies are enabled by default in the following scenarios:

**Tenants with new Power Automate premium license**: Starting February 2024, tenants with a new Power Automate premium license have a new auto-claim license policy in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Power Automate. This policy ensures that users who need a Power Automate premium license receive it automatically, if the license is available in your tenant. By default, this policy is applied across all environments.

**Tenants with Managed Environments**: Starting April 2024, tenants using managed environments have a new auto-claim license policy in the Microsoft 365 admin center for Power Automate. This policy ensures that users who need a Power Automate premium or per-user plan (legacy) license receive it automatically, if the license is available in your tenant. By default, this policy is applied to users in managed environments. However, admins can also choose to extend this policy to apply to standard environments in the Power Platform admin center.

### Can administrators update the policy?

Yes, administrators can manage the policy in the Microsoft 365 admin center just like any other auto-claim policy. Administrators can disable the policy, delete it, and view reports on which users were assigned licenses.

In the Power Platform admin center, administrators can decide whether the policy should apply to Managed Environments only or all environments.

1. Sign in to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
1. Select **Settings** > **Auto-claim policies**.
1. On the **Auto-claim policies** pane, select whether the policy should be applicable to **All Environments** or **Only Managed Environments**.

### Support for group-based license assignment

Auto-claim policies support individual license assignment, which means that licenses are assigned to individual users. If your organization already has an existing process for license assignment, administrators can still make use of the auto-claim policy while maintaining their current workflow.

Administrators can review the list of users to whom licenses were assigned through the auto-claim policy in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Then, they can make changes, as needed, such as unassigning auto-claim-assigned licenses and moving users to designated groups to use Microsoft Entra group-based licensing. For more information about group based licensing, go to [Group-based licensing scenarios](/entra/identity/users/licensing-group-advanced).

Here are some commands that can help in unassigning licenses and adding users to the required Microsoft Entra group.

```PowerShell
##
#Install and import AzureAD PowerShell module prior to running these commands
##
##You might be able to get a list of users, that have been auto-assigned a 
##license directly, via Microsoft Admin Center. Follow instructions at 
##https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/commerce/licenses/manage-auto-claim-policies?view=o365-worldwide#view-an-auto-claim-policy-report
##
##Once you have a list of users, you can use the following commands to remove 
##the direct license assignment and add the user to a licensed group, or 
##you might tweak the script to iterate through a list of users and 
##perform this in bulk
##
##Please note that adding a user to a licensed group might not result in an 
##immediate license assignment. Refer to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/licensing-group-advanced for more information

#Create the AssignedLicenses Object, used for removing direct license assignment from the user
$LicensesToRemove = New-Object -TypeName Microsoft.Open.AzureAD.Model.AssignedLicenses
$LicensesToRemove.RemoveLicenses = $LicenseSku.SkuId

#Remove directly assigned license from the user
#Note that this command will result in an error if the user does not have the relevant license assigned directly

#Add user to a licensed group
Add-AzureADGroupMember -ObjectId $LicensedGroup.ObjectId -RefObjectId $LicensedUser.ObjectId

```

## Limitations

This section presents all the limitations of the auto-claim policy for Power Automate.

### Auto-claim policy might take up to two hours to activate after creation

After creating the Power Automate license auto-claim policy, it might take up to two hours for the configured policy to be activated and propagated across the relevant Microsoft services.

### Successful license auto-claim isn't immediately reflected in Power Automate portal

When a Power Automate user license is auto-claimed, there might be a slight delay before the license status is updated in the Power Automate portal. During this period, the portal might indicate that the user doesn't have the auto-claimed license. However, the user does have access to premium features despite the portal's display.
