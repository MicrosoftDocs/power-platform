## Manage licenses


### Assign Process license

Here are the two steps you must take if you want to assign a Process license.

1. Allocate the Process license to an environment in the Power Platform admin center.

1. Assign a Process license to a flow.

   > [!NOTE]
   > To run unattended desktop flows in an environment, you need to assign one Process license per machine that is used for unattended desktop flows. If you need to run multiple unattended desktop flows in parallel on a machine, you will also need to assign one Process license for each additional Desktop Flow you want to run concurrently on the machine.

It's easy and scalable to allocate the Process licenses you've purchased to the environments that need the licenses. In the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) under capacity, you'll see a new section appears if your organization has purchased the licenses.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about how to allocate the Process license to an environment in the Power Platform admin center, see [capacity add-ons for Power Apps and Power Automate](../capacity-add-on.md) section.

Follow these steps to allocate add-ons to an environment.

1. Select **Resources** > **Capacity** on the left side of the screen.
1. Select **Add-ons** > in the capacity page.
1. Select the edit button on an environment.
1. Enter the amount of each add-on you would like to allocate to each environment.

   > [!TIP]
   > Power Automate Process is the same as Process license.
   > [!NOTE]
   > The Process license is environment specific. So, if you have multiple environments that need to run a flow and/or unattended desktop flow, you need to assign the Process license in each environment.

  
1. Select **Save**.

   ![An image that displays the steps needed to assign a license to an environment.](../media/power-automate-licensing/assign-process-license-environment.png)

   After you assign the Process licenses to an environment, you can choose which flows can use the Process licenses.

1. In [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/), choose the flow to which you want to add the license. Owners, co-owners of the flow and admins can assign a Process license to a flow.

   When you select a flow, you'll now see a new section in the details pane that tells you if the flow is assigned to a user, or if it is part of the Process license. The default for a flow is to use the license of the user.

1. To have a flow use the Process license, select  **Edit** in the details panel. You will then see the **Name**, **Description** and **Plan** that the flow uses. If your environment has the Process license assigned, you can move that flow to use the Process license. Otherwise, you'll need to assign capacity.

   ![Image that shows that not per flow capacity is available.](../media/power-automate-licensing/per-flow-plan-capacity-needed.png)

After you update your flow, anyone will be able to use that flow, even if it leverages premium connectors. Additionally, capacity will be dedicated to that flow.

### Assign per user licenses to user

1. Sign in to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/), select **Users** > **Active users**.

   ![Image displays active users selected.](../media/power-automate-licensing/active-users.png)

1. Select the user to whom you'll assign the license.
1. Select **Licenses and apps**.

1. Select the checkbox for the license you want to assign to the user, and then save your changes.

   ![This image displays the list of licenses that can be assigned to a user.](../media/power-automate-licensing/user-licenses-apps.png)

### Assign per flow license

Here are the two steps you must take if you want to assign a per flow license.

1. Allocate the per flow license to an environment in the Power Platform admin center.

1. Assign a per flow license to a flow.

It's easy and scalable to allocate the per flow add-ons you've purchased to the environments that need add-ons. In the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/) under capacity, you'll see a new section appears if your organization has purchased add-ons.

> [!TIP]
> To learn more about how to allocate the per flow license to an environment in the Power Platform admin center, see [capacity add-ons for Power Apps and Power Automate](../capacity-add-on.md) section.

Follow these steps to allocate add-ons to an environment.

1. Select **Resources** > **Capacity** on the left side of the screen.
1. Select **Add-ons** > **Manage** in the add-on section.
1. Select an environment.
1. Enter the amount of each add-on you would like to allocate to each environment.

   > [!TIP]
   > Flow per business process is same as per flow license.
   > [!NOTE]
   > The per flow plan is environment specific. So, if you have multiple environments that need to run a flow, you need to assign per flow license to the flow in each environment.
1. Select **Save**.

   ![An image that displays the steps needed to assign a license to an environment and manage add-ons.](../media/power-automate-licensing/assign-license-environment.png)

   After you assign a per flow plan add-on to an environment, you can choose which flows can use that add-on.

1. In [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com/), choose the flow to which you want to add the license. Owners, co-owners of the flow and admins can assign a per flow license to a flow.

   When you select a flow, you'll now see a new section in the details pane that tells you if the flow is assigned to a user, or if it is part of the per-flow plan. The default for a flow is to use the license of the user.

   ![An image that displays that a flow uses per user plan by default.](../media/power-automate-licensing/per-user-plan-assigned.png)

1. To have a flow use the per-flow plan, select  **Edit** in the details panel. You will then see the **Name**, **Description** and **Plan** that the flow uses. If your environment has the per flow add-on allocated, you can move that flow to use the per flow plan. Otherwise, you'll need to allocate capacity.

   ![Image that shows that not per flow capacity is available.](../media/power-automate-licensing/per-flow-plan-capacity-needed.png)

After you update your flow, anyone will be able to use that flow, even if it leverages premium connectors. Additionally, capacity will be dedicated to that flow.

### Assign unattended RPA add-on to an environment

In the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/), select **Resources** > **Capacity** > **Manage** in add-ons to assign add-ons.

![An image that displays how to assign unattended add-ons.](../media/power-automate-licensing/assign-unattended-add-on.png)

Users can now run unattended desktop flows within the environment that has the unattended capacity.

> [!NOTE]
> The unattended add-on is environment specific. So, if you have multiple environments that need to run unattended RPA, you need to assign add-on capacity to each of them. Also, if you need to run multiple unattended desktop flows in parallel in a single environment, you need to assign the right number of unattended add-ons to the environment to support the parallel flow runs.

### Assign capacity add-on to an environment

Consult this article to learn more about [capacity add-ons for Power Apps and Power Automate](../capacity-add-on.md)

### FAQ

#### I assigned a premium license to a user, but the user can't use premium features. Why?

It might take up to a week for all the downstream systems to receive updates. To force an update for a particular flow, turn the flow off and on or edit and save the flow.

#### How do I remove Power Automate from the app launcher for a user?

If a user was assigned a Power Automate license, you can take the following steps to remove the license for that user. This action removes the Power Automate icon from the app launcher.

1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).
2. In the left navigation bar, select  **Users**  >   **Active Users**.
3. Find the user for whom you want to remove the license, and then select their name.
4. On the user details pane, select the **Licenses and Apps**  tab, and then uncheck the license for Power Automate.
5. At the bottom, select  **Save changes**.

It's also possible to do a bulk removal of licenses through PowerShell. See [Remove licenses from user accounts with Microsoft 365 PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/remove-licenses-from-user-accounts-with-microsoft-365-powershell) for a detailed example.

Additional guidance about bulk removal of services within a license can be found in the [Disable access to services with Microsoft 365 PowerShell](/microsoft-365/enterprise/disable-access-to-services-with-microsoft-365-powershell) article.

> [!NOTE]
> This action removes the Power Automate tile by default. A user may still choose to use Power Automate as an individual.

#### Why did 10,000 licenses for Power Automate show up in my Microsoft 365 tenant?

Any person can try out Power Automate free for 90 days, and these trial licenses represent the available capacity for new Power Automate users in your tenant. There is no charge for these licenses.

If at least one user in your tenant has signed up for a Microsoft Power Automate free license, you will see 10,000 licenses (minus any assigned licenses) under **Billing** > **Licenses**  for your organization.

You can choose to assign additional licenses to users yourself through the Microsoft 365 admin center but note that these are trial licenses for Power Automate, and they will expire 90 days after you assigned them to a user.

#### Is trial free? Will I be charged for these licenses?

No user can incur any cost to your organization without your express consent, so neither free nor trial licenses can cause any charges to your organization. Moreover, they also don't use any quotas, such as run quotas.

#### I removed the Power Automate free license and users can still access it

The Power Automate free license is included only for tracking purposes. It's not possible to prevent another person from using Power Automate for individual purposes. Thus, the presence of a Power Automate free license does not actually grant or remove any capabilities.

#### Why can't I see all Power Automate licenses in the Microsoft 365 admin center?

Users can use Power Automate either as individuals or as a part of their organization. Licenses at the organizational level will always be visible in the Microsoft 365 admin center. However, if a user signs up for a trial as an individual then that is not managed by their Microsoft 365 admin and will it won't  display in the Microsoft 365 admin center.

#### How can I restrict my users' ability to access my organization's business data?

Power Automate allows you to create data groups for business and non-business data. After you implement these data loss prevention policies, users cannot design nor run flows that combine business and non-business data. For more details, See [Data loss prevention (DLP) policies](/power-automate/prevent-data-loss).
