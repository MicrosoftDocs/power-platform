# Types of Power Automate licenses

Power Automate supports both user and capacity licensing. With a Power Automate Premium user license, users gain the full set of capabilities for cloud and desktop automation including premium connectors, process and task mining, AI Builder, use of Managed Environments, and Microsoft Dataverse storage.

For additional capacity, running desktop flows unattended, or licensing flows on their own without use licenses, subscribe to Power Automate Process licenses or enable pay-as-you-go. To extend further, [additional add-ons](add-ons.md) are available for hosted machines, RPA unattended bots expanding Dataverse storage, AI credits, and other resources.

Other licenses across Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and the Power Platform include a limited set of Power Automate capabilities. Learn more about what's included in each license in [Microsoft Power Platform Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130).

|License type |License scope |Description |
|-------|------|------|
|User license| User-centric: a user license is assigned to a user.|It entitles the user to access specific capabilities.|
|Capacity license| Automation-centric: a capacity license is allocated to a Power Automate automation (cloud flow, machine, hosted machine, hosted machine group).|It provides the automation entitlements (the same way a user license provides entitlements to a user).|

You can subscribe to Power Automate licenses on [Power Automate pricing](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/products/power-automate/pricing). If you're an administrator, you can also [purchase licenses from the Microsoft 365 admin center](buy-licenses.md).

## User licenses

:::image type="content" source="../media/RPA-license/standalone_user_licenses-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of user licenses.":::

In addition to Power Automate Premium or [use rights from other licenses](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130), users can be licensed with Power Automate trial license to try out premium capabilities. They can also use the Free license to create cloud flows with standard connectors.

# [**Power Automate Premium license**](#tab/power-automate-premium)

#### Power Automate Premium

|License name |Power Automate Premium |
|--------|--------|
|**License type**|User license (paid)|
|**Entitlements**|We recommend the Power Automate Premium license for all users, as it gives them the full set of capabilities to create both API based and desktop automations.<br><br>This license allows users to create, run, and share unlimited cloud flows (within [Power Platform requests (PPR) limits](../api-request-limits-allocations.md#request-limits-in-power-automate) for API-based automation (with standard, premium, and custom connectors) and to automate their legacy applications simulating a human behavior such as keyboard or mouse keys and movement (with desktop flows through robotic process automation (RPA).<br><br>More precisely regarding the [premium RPA entitlements](/power-automate/desktop-flows/premium-features), this license includes the ability for users to register their workstation, to create unlimited desktop flows, and to execute their desktop flows in attended mode on their registered machine through an attended bot borne by the license. <br><br>Additionally, this license also includes full access to process mining capabilities and the provisioning of AI Builder credits, which support AI consuming scenarios like form processing, object detection, text classification, and more.|

## Capacity licenses

:::image type="content" source="../media/RPA-license/standalone_capacity_licenses-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot of capacity licenses.":::

In addition to user licenses, organizations can upgrade their automation scenarios with capacity licenses, which are allocated to Power Automate automations (cloud flows, machines, hosted machines, hosted machine groups) and provide these automations autonomous entitlements (regardless of the user license owned by persons interacting with those automations).

# [**Power Automate Process license**](#tab/power-automate-process)

#### Power Automate Process

|License name |Power Automate Process |
|--------|--------|
|**License type**|Capacity license (paid)|
|**Allocated automation**|- Cloud flow <br>- Standard machine|
|**Entitlements**|When [assigned to a cloud flow](/power-automate/desktop-flows/capacity-process#allocate-process-capacity-to-a-cloud-flow), a Power Automate Process license entitles it to [better performance](/power-automate/limits-and-config#performance-profiles), and allows use of premium and custom connectors regardless of the owning or triggering user's license. Flows must be in a solution for a Process license to be assigned. <br><br>[Allocated to a machine](/power-automate/desktop-flows/capacity-process), a Process license becomes an unattended bot that can run one desktop flow at a time. Up to one cloud flow will automatically inherit the Process plan from the the related machine or machine group that has Process capacity assigned.  To run multiple unattended desktop flows in parallel, purchase Process licenses for the maximum number of runs that are needed to execute in parallel, and allocate Process capacity to the related machines. <br><br> To [trigger attended or attended desktop flow runs](/power-automate/desktop-flows/trigger-desktop-flows) from cloud flows that are operating under the Process license, the user whose connection is being used to run the desktop flow needs a Power Automate Premium license (or other user license with desktop flows entitlement). <br><br>Each Process license includes up to 250,000 [Power Platform Requests](/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations#Request-limits-in-power-automate) per 24 hours. For requests above this, support for stacking capacity from multiple Process licenses is coming soon. To ensure you purchase sufficient capacity for the flow to operate, we recommended purchasing Process licenses up to the maximum requests per 24 hours you anticipate from the process.|
|**Will benefit**|Organizations looking to automate their business processes at scale using cloud flows or unattended desktop automations, or maintain a flow without each co-owner needing a user license.

# [**Power Automate Hosted Process license**](#tab/power-automate-hosted-process)

#### Power Automate Hosted Process

|License name |Power Automate Hosted Process |
|--------|--------|
|**License type**|Capacity license (paid)|
|**Allocated object**|- Hosted machine <br>- Hosted machine group<br>- Cloud flow<br>- Machine|
|**Entitlements**|The Hosted Process license enables [RPA with zero infrastructure](/power-automate/desktop-flows/hosted-rpa-overview) with no physical machine management on the user side. Each Hosted Process license can support one hosted bot, which enables the creation of one Microsoft hosted machine requires.<br><br>Those hosted machines can be created as individual hosted machines or as part of hosted machine groups, which provide 1) auto-scalability delivering high processing parallelization and reacting to demand spikes and 2) [load balancing](/power-automate/desktop-flows/hosted-machine-groups#load-balance-hosted-machine-group)<sup>1</sup> across multiple hosted machine groups, which optimizes the hosted bot utilization rate.<br><br>The Power Automate Hosted Process is also a superset of the Power Automate Process, which means it can provide the same entitlements as the Process license (allocated to a cloud flow or to a machine).<sup>2</sup>|
|**Will benefit**|Organizations looking to enable their RPA desktop automations quickly and at scale while freeing up the previously required management of physical resources and thus reducing costs.|

<sup>1</sup> Load balancing refers to the ability of multiple hosted machine groups to scale-up and down at different moments using a common hosted pool. The load balancing governance is managed through the max bots and committed bots scaling settings.

<sup>2</sup> The Power Automate Hosted Process superset behavior (allowing it to be applied to machines and cloud flows) isn't yet available. In the meantime, any organization with [Process overage](/power-automate/desktop-flows/capacity-utilization-process#capacity-overage) that could be covered by its Hosted Process licenses should ignore the Process overage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ***Can my organization only purchase and use capacity licenses within an environment?***
>
> Capacity licenses aren't meant to replace user licenses in an environment, as some essential capabilities are only available to licensed users, including creating and running automations running desktop flows attended or unattended.  create automations. Capacity licenses can grant higher [Power Platform requests (PPR)](../api-request-limits-allocations.md#request-limits-in-power-automate) to such flows built using the premium user licenses.
>
> Allocation of a Process license to a machine (required by the unattended mode) still prerequires the machine to have been registered by a Power Automate Premium user.
>
> Multiple monitoring pages in the Power Automate portal (for example, workqueue page, machine list page, desktop flow list page, and more) are displayed only to Power Automate Premium users.

## License entitlements

Power Automate licenses include entitlements to use specific Power Automate capabilities. This section lists the supported entitlements. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/RPA-license/entitlement_list.png" alt-text="Screenshot of license entitlements.":::

# [**Connector types**](#tab/connector-types)

#### Entitlements to usage of connector types in cloud flows
A [connector](/connectors/overview) represents the underlying service (such as OneDrive, SharePoint, Salesforce, etc.) with which a cloud flow can interact. It provides a way for a user to connect its cloud flow to a third-party account (such as a Salesforce account) and use a set of prebuilt actions and triggers.

|Entitlement to  |Entitlement description |
|----------|-------|
|Standard connectors|The [standard connectors](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-standard-connectors) entitlement is needed to add a standard connector to a cloud flow and trigger it.|
|Premium connectors|The [premium connectors](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-standard-connectors) entitlement is needed to add a premium connector to a cloud flow and trigger it.|
|Custom connectors|The [custom connectors](/connectors/custom-connectors) entitlement is needed to create a connector with its own triggers and actions when an app / a service does't have a prebuilt connector.|

# [**Robotic Process Automation**](#tab/rpa)

#### Entitlements to usage of Robotic process automation (RPA)
[Robotic process automation (RPA)](/power-automate/desktop-flows/introduction) is needed to interact with applications, which are lacking a prebuilt connector and which don't have APIs that could be used to build a custom connector. With RPA, you automate applications by teaching Power Automate for Desktop to mimic the mouse movements and keyboard entries of a human user, as if a robot was using the computer. 

|Entitlement to |Entitlement description |
|----------|-------|
|Attended RPA|The attended RPA entitlement is needed to perform most of the RPA related operations: register a machine, access RPA management portal pages, add premium and custom actions to desktop flows, share desktop flows, create desktop flows in non-default environments and trigger desktop flows in __attended mode__ through an attended bot (in default attended mode or in Picture-in-picture attended mode). <br><br>Attended run mode refers to a desktop flow execution with human supervision, it's materialized by __attended bots__: the Trial user license and the Premium user license bear one attended bot each.<br><br> When an attended run is triggered, the attended bot securely accesses the machine already is use by the user and executes the desktop flow actions on the target applications.<br><br> Picture-in-picture attended mode refers to attended desktop flows executions within a virtual window that replicates the user's desktop, so that they can continue working on their machine while the automation is running in parallel.|
|Unattended RPA|The unattended RPA entitlement is needed to trigger desktop flows in __unattended mode__ through an unattended bot. <br><br>Unattended run mode refers to a desktop flow execution without human supervision, it's materialized by __unattended bots__: the Trial user license and the Process license bear one unattended bot each (to be allocated to a machine for the Process license). <br><br> When an unattended run is triggered, the unattended bot securely signs into the  machine on user's behalf, executes the desktop flow actions on the target applications, and then signs out of the device.|
|Hosted RPA|The hosted RPA entitlement is needed to create and turn on a __Microsoft hosted machine__ (individual hosted machine or part of a hosted machine group) thus enabling [RPA with zero infrastructure](/power-automate/desktop-flows/hosted-rpa-overview) with no physical machine management on the user side.<br><br>An active (= turned-on) hosted machine is materialized by an __hosted bot__: each Hosted Process license supports one hosted bot.<br><br>As the Hosted Process license is a superset of the Process license, the hosted entitlement implicitly includes the unattended entitlement, meaning that each hosted bot can also be seen as an unattended bot (= provides the unattended run mode capability on the hosted machines (individual or part of a group)).|

To learn more about the premium RPA capabilities, go to [Premium RPA features](/power-automate/desktop-flows/premium-features).

# [**Other capabilities**](#tab/other-capabilities)

#### Entitlements to other Power Automate capabilities

|Entitlement to |Entitlement description |
|----------|-------|
|Business process flows|The [business process flows](/power-automate/business-process-flows-overview) entitlement is needed to create a business process flow. Business process flows provide a guide for people to get work done they offer a streamlined user experience that leads people through the processes their organization defined.|
|On premises gateway|The [on-premises data gateway](/power-automate/gateway-reference) entitlement is needed to create and use an on-premises data gateway. It acts as a bridge to provide quick and secure data transfer between on-premises data and several Microsoft cloud services. With gateways, organizations can keep databases and other data sources on-premises and securely use that on-premises data in cloud services.|
|Process mining|The process mining entitlement is needed to use the process mining and task mining capabilities of Power Automate.|

# [**Consumptive credit and storage**](#tab/consumptive-credit-and-storage)

#### Consumptive credits and storage entitlements

|Entitlement to |Entitlement description |
|----------|-------|
|AI Builder credits|With [AI builder](/power-automate/use-ai-builder), you add intelligence to your automations, predict outcomes, and help improve business performance. AI Builder capacity is expressed in the form of "service credits." Service credits serve as the single (common) currency across all the scenarios that AI Builder supports. Available service credits are deducted when AI Builder services are used. For instance, you could use these credits to extract data from a few documents with _form processing_ or perform hundreds of basic text extractions. Different scenarios (for example, forms processing, prediction, etc.) consume service credits at different rates. Learn more about [AI builder licensing](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq).|
|Dataverse database and file storage|Data volume continues to grow exponentially as businesses advance their digital transformation journey and bring data together across their organizations. Modern business applications need to support new business scenarios, manage new data types, and help organizations with the increasing complexity of compliance mandates. To support the growing needs of today's organizations, data storage solutions need to evolve continuously and provide the right solution to support expanding business needs. Microsoft Dataverse capacity storage is optimized for relational data (database), attachments (file), and audit logs (log). Some Power Automate license provide a tenant-wide entitlement for each of these three storage types. You can buy more storage in 1-GB add-on increments. Learn more about [Dataverse capacity storage](../capacity-storage.md).|
|Process mining data storage|The process mining capability in Power Automate is suited for discovery of inefficiencies in organization-wide processes. It enables you to gain a deep understanding of your processes using event log files that you can get from your system of recording (apps you use in your processes). The process mining capability displays maps of your processes with data and metrics to recognize performance issues.|
