# Subscription Tracking Deleted Object Table

The **SubscriptionTrackingDeletedObject** table is linked to the **DeletionService** that handles two types of cleanup: organization-wide and records. When records are initially deleted from entity tables, they're added to the **dbo.SubscriptionTrackingDeletedObject** table. This table supplies the **DeletionService** with **ObjectIDs** of removed items for asynchronous cleanup.
