# Managed availability
[!INCLUDE[new-PPAC-banner](~/includes/new-PPAC-banner.md)]

Managed availability provides robust capabilities to ensure continuous uptime, seamless failover, and enterprise-grade resilience for mission-critical applications and AI workloads. Built on Microsoft Azure, these features safeguard businesses against failures, outages, and disruptions, ensuring high availability without compromising performance.

## What can you do with managed availability?
Managed availability is a suite of premium capabilities designed to ensure the resilience, responsiveness, and reliability of AI agents built with Microsoft Copilot Studio. It provides seamless failover, self-healing systems, and disaster-proof architecture, allowing businesses to run their intelligent automation workflows securely and at scale. By proactively mitigating disruptions and maintaining uninterrupted operations, managed availability empowers organizations to safeguard their AI-driven processes against a wide range of unforeseen events. 

## Increased resiliency with Azure availability zones
Managed availability leverages Azure availability zones to replicate production environments across multiple datacenters within a region. These zones are physically separated and operate independently with distinct power, networking, and cooling systems. This ensures:

- **Near zero data loss**: Synchronous replication across typically two and in some cases three zones.
- **Rapid failover**: Recovery time objective (RTO) of less than five minutes.
- **Minimal service disruption**: Automatic redirection of traffic during zone-level failures.

## Automated backups and self-serve disaster recovery
Environments with databases benefit from automated backups that can be restored to any system backup from the past seven days (extendable to 28 days for managed environments). 

> [!Note]
> Self-serve disaster recovery is currently in public preview. Learn more about this feature in [Business continuity and disaster recovery](business-continuity-disaster-recovery.md).

Self-serve disaster recovery allows organizations to:
- Define and test cross-region failover strategies directly from the Power Platform admin center.
- Maintain a secondary environment copy in another region for business continuity.
- Activate emergency response modes for quick recovery during major outages.

Self-serve disaster recovery also supports disaster recovery drills and failback capabilities that empower administrators to decide whether and when to switch back to the primary location after an outage.
