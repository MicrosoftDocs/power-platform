# What is the Checklist template Microsoft Power Platform?

The Checklist template provides a quick way to create custom checklists tailored to specific needs. Once set up, you can use the Checklist app to document and report on a wide range of tasks and projects. The app even includes options to use detailed steps and sub-steps, so it's a great app to use for complex repair and maintenance tasks.

The Checklist template comes with many capabilities:

- Custom checklist template creation for report production
- Step and sub-step definition for each custom template
- Inventory management, including item addition and categorization
- Customized template use for generating inventory reports
- Report navigation that allows you to skip and revisit steps and sub-steps as needed

You can extend the capabilities of the Checklist template by customizing the apps to meet your organization's needs.

The Checklist template package is available on Microsoft AppSource.

The Checklist solution contains components that enable the user and admin experiences. It has all the componentsâ€¯that enable you to create and manage custom checklist templates and create and manage reports for inventory items.
