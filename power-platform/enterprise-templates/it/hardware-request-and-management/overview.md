# Hardware Request and Management template for Power Platform

The Hardware Request and Management template enables your organization to digitize and automate asset requests and management. Employees can request new hardware, such as laptops, keyboards, and monitors.
Program admins or managers can perform several functions, such as:

- Configure a hardware product catalog and business and budget units with respective approvers
- Use copilot (AI) and Microsoft Teams embedded capabilities to process asset requests
- View interactive dashboards to oversee the employee request process and monitor and manage the asset inventory

When employees make requests for new hardware, the requests are reviewed and processed by program admins leveraging insights, AI (copilot), and Microsoft Teams embedded capabilities.

The Hardware Request and Management template is available two ways.

- [Microsoft AppSource](<https://aka.ms/HardwareRequestAndManagementTemplate>).
- [Templates for Power Platform] project site on GitHub(<https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformTemplateSupport>)

The template package consists of two solutions:

- **IT Base** contains common foundational components that all IT template solutions use. For now, this is limited to components that limit localization and integration error handling capabilities. By sharing this across solutions, common strings can be localized once the base solution and all dependent solutions get the benefit. Errors across all IT solutions can also be monitored.

- **Hardware Request and Management** contains all the components needed to enable the Hardware Request and Management experience in your organization.

## Hardware Request and Management solution components

The Hardware Request and Management solution file contains the following Power Platform capabilities that can easily be customized to fit your own organizational requirements:
