# Install and set up the Parking Reservation template for Power Platform

Enterprise templates for Power Platform are enterprise-ready solutions that are designed to be installed, customized, deployed, and managed by a [centralized team](/power-platform/guidance/adoption/delivery-models#centralized) at your organization to support common [governance and security](/power-platform/guidance/adoption/admin-best-practices) practices.

Establish a centralized team that consists of key stakeholders, product owners, and Power Platform admins and developers. Be sure to review Power Platform best-practices and administration resource links and to develop plans that suit your organization's needs.

More information:

- [Power Platform adoption best practices](/power-platform/guidance/adoption/methodology)
- [Administer Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/admin-documentation)
- [Working with enterprise systems](/power-apps/guidance/planning/enterprise-systems)

As a Microsoft Power Platform admin, follow the steps outlined in this article to install and set up the Hardware Request and Management template.

## Step 1: Review prerequisites

Review the requirements, identify opportunities and develop a plan of action that suits your organization's needs.

### Confirm licensing

Confirm your organization has the necessary licensing to use enterprise templates. You need:

- One of the following Power Apps plans:

  - Power Apps Premium
  - Power Apps per app
  - Power Apps per app pay-as-you-go-meter
  - Power Apps use rights included with Dynamics 365 licenses

> [!NOTE]
>
> Power Apps use rights included with Microsoft 365 and Office 365 licenses will not suffice to install the template.

- A Power BI Pro or higher license. More information: [Pricing and Product Comparison](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/pricing/)

> [!TIP]
> A free Developer Plan combined with a free Power BI in Microsoft Fabric free account is a great way to install the template for evaluation purposes.

### Set up environments and data policies

It's important to have a cohesive environment and data policy and to ensure required resources in place.

- **Administrators**

  Make sure that admins with the necessary privileges are available to assign licenses and create environments:

  - Microsoft tenant User Administrator to assign Power Apps or Power BI licensing
  - Power Platform Administrator to create environments

  [Learn more about Microsoft Power Platform administration](/power-platform/admin/).

- **Environments**

  - Follow [application lifecycle management (ALM)](/power-platform/alm/) best practices in [creating and managing environments](/power-platform/admin/create-environment).
  - Make sure that a Power Platform environment is set up with a Dataverse database.
  - Make sure that environment maker security role privileges, at a minimum, are assigned to the user who installs the solutions in that environment.

  [Learn more about Power Platform environments](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview).

- **Data loss prevention policies**

  Make sure that the environment has access to connectors used by the template:

  - [Microsoft Dataverse](/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/)
  - [Office 365 Outlook](/connectors/office365/)
  
Learn more about [Data loss prevention policies](/power-platform/admin/wp-data-loss-prevention).

## Step 2: Create connections

Cloud flows need specific connection references to work correctly. Connection references are included in the solution, but connectors often need to be manually set up. You need to set up three new connections for the Parking Reservation app.

It's best to create the connections before you import the solution. If you create the connections during import, you must jump between browser windows.

To create connections in advance, take these steps:

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.preview.powerapps.com).
1. Go to **Connections** and select **+ New Connection** to create new connections with each of these connectors:

    - [Dataverse](/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/)
    - [Office 365 Outlook](/connectors/office365/)

## Step 3: Install solution files

You have two options for installing the Parking Reservation solution:

- [Select **Get it now** on the template's AppSource page](#install-from-appsource) and an installation window opens automatically in the Power Platform admin center.
- [Download a managed or unmanaged version of the solution files and manually import them into your environment](#download-and-manually-install-solution-files).

> [!TIP]
>
> Go to the [Templates-for-Power-Platform](https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformTemplateSupport) GitHub project site to log your questions or issues and get support for the Appointment Booking template.

### Install from AppSource

AppSource is a Microsoft digital storefront. Take these steps to go through the AppSource install process:

1. Go to the [Parking Reservation template](<https://aka.ms/AccessAppointmentBookingTemplate>) in AppSource and select **Get it now**.
1. In the *Install Parking Reservation Template* window in the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/), select the developer environment that you prepared in the [review prerequisites step](#step-1-review-prerequisites).

### Download and manually install solution files

1. In the left pane, select **Solutions**.
1. Select **Import solution**,and then find and select the **managed** or **unmanaged version** of the `mpa_ITBase` file downloaded.

Step 4: Assign security roles

Set up security roles in your solutions so admins can manage access, language support, and experiences in the app.

There are four security roles:

- **IT Base - IT Base User** - Assign this role to an admin who needs to perform specific admin tasks such as localizing strings and monitoring for errors.
-
