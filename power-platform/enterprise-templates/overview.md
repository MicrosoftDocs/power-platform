Templates for Power Platform offer the following benefits:

- **Time to value**
  - Remove many of the upfront investments needed in traditional enterprise software development.
  - Reduce sets of resources and skills needed to deploy.
  - Gain new business insights through digitized and connected processes.

- **Maximize existing IT investments**
  - Continue to drive value out of existing major IT investments like ERP, CRM, IT, and HR systems.
  - Protect and maintain systems of record and data sources of truth.

- **Productivity**
  - Reduce inefficiencies in manual processes.
  - Connect data across multiple systems of record to complete a workflow.
  - Meet users where they are, whether in Teams or in other collaborative experiences.
