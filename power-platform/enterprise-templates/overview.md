## Benefits of using enterprise templates

Implementing enterprise software use cases can be time consuming and expensive.  An enterprise template provides a foundation to help you quickly get started. You can use the full potential of Power Platform to extend the templates by connecting workflows across more systems of record and digitizing manually intensive processes.

Templates for Power Platform offer the following benefits:

- **Time to value**
  - Remove many of the upfront investments needed in traditional enterprise software development.
  - Reduce sets of resources and skills needed to deploy.
  - Gain new business insights through digitized and connected processes.

- **Maximize existing IT investments**
  - Continue to drive value out of existing major IT investments like ERP, CRM, IT, and HR systems.
  - Protect and maintain systems of record and data sources of truth.

- **Productivity**
  - Reduce inefficiencies in manual processes.
  - Connect data across multiple systems of record to complete a workflow.
  - Meet users where they are, whether in Teams or in other collaborative experiences.
