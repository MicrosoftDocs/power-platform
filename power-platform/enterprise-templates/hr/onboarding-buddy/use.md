# Get started using the Onboarding Buddy app

There are three kinds of users who interact with the Onboarding Buddy app in some way:

- **Manager**. As a manager, you use the Onboarding Buddy app to match available Buddies with Onboarders within teams.
- **Buddy**. As a Buddy, you use the app to sign up as a Buddy and receive emails throughout the program.
- **Onboarder**. As an Onboarder, you're set up in the program to get matched and receive emails, but you don't use the app directly.

> [!NOTE]
> There are two admin roles that may also directly use the Onboarding Buddy app even though their primary functions are to configure and manage the app.
>
> - **Power Platform admin**. As a Power Platform admin, you install and configure the Onboarding Buddy Admin app for the Program admin and the Onboarding Buddy app for users.
> - **Program admin**. As a Program admin, you manage the Onboarding Buddy program through the Onboarding Buddy Admin app.

## Use the Onboarding Buddy app as a Buddy

A Buddy is an employee who wants to make themselves available as someone who can be matched to Onboarders. Buddies help the Onboarders orientate and onboard successfully. Buddies use the Onboarding Buddy canvas app to:

- Sign up to be a Buddy.
- Update their Buddy profile.

### Sign up to be a Buddy
