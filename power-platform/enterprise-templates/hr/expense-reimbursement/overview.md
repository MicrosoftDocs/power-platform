# Expense Reimbursement template for Power Platform

The Expense Reimbursement template makes it easy to set up and facilitate an automated expense reimbursement program within your organization.

The Expense Reimbursement program enables:

- Employees in your organization to submit expense reimbursement requests with receipt documentation in the canvas app. The canvas app can be accessed from a desktop or mobile device.
- Your organization to streamline and automate the request processes in the model-driven admin app.

You can further extend the capabilities of the Expense Reimbursement template by customizing the apps to meet your organization's unique processing needs.

## Expense Reimbursement package

The Expense Reimbursement template is available in [Microsoft AppSource](<https://aka.ms/AccessRefundRequestTemplate>). The template package consists of two solutions:

- **Employee Experience Base** contains common foundational components that all human resource (HR) solutions use. For now, only components that are needed for localization capabilities are included. Common strings can be localized once in the base solution and shared so that all dependent solutions get the benefit.
- **Expense Reimbursement** contains all the components necessaryâ€¯to enable users to submit requests for expense reimbursements and manage the requests.

### Employee Experience Base

The **Employee Experience Base** solution contains components that manage app language preferences.

- **Employee Experience Localization Admin** is the model-driven app that allows admins to view and edit localized string values.
- **Employee Experience Localization** is the table that stores the string replacements for every localized version of the app.
- **ISO Employee Experience Language Code** is the *one choice* that stores the abbreviations for the available language codes.
- Two security roles:
  - **Employee Experience Localization Reader** provides *read* access to the table.
  - **Employee Experience Localizer** provides *create*, *read*, *update*, and *delete* access to the table.
