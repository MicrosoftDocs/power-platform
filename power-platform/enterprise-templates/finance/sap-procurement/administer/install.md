- Managed
  - [mpa_SAPBase_managed.zip](https://aka.ms/SAPBaseManagedSolution)
  - [mpa_SAPProcurement_managed.zip](https://aka.ms/SAPProcurementManagedSolution)
- Unmanaged
  - [mpa_SAPBase_unmanaged.zip](https://aka.ms/SAPBaseUnmanagedSolution)
  - [mpa_SAPProcurement_unmanaged.zip](https://aka.ms/SAPProcurementUnmanagedSolution)

> [!TIP]
>
> Go to the [Templates-for-Power-Platform](https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformTemplateSupport) GitHub project site to log your questions or issues and get support for the SAP Procurement template.

## Install the solution files

Once you have downloaded **either** the *managed* or *unmanaged* solution files, you can install them into the developer (sandbox) environment that you prepared for them.

### Install the SAP Base solution

Follow these steps to install either the *managed* or *unmanaged* **SAP Base** solution:

1. Select **Solutions** on the left pane.
1. Select **Import solution**.
1. Browse for and select either the managed *or* unmanaged version of the **mpa_SAPBase** file downloaded in previous step.
1. Enter the environment variables when prompted, using the [Configure environment variables](configure-environment-variables.md) guidance.
1. Select **Import** to start the import process of the *SAP Base* solution. Once the import is complete, you're notified with a *Success* message.

### Install the SAP Procurement solution

1. Go to **Solutions** on the left pane of the *Power Apps maker portal* after the SAP Base solution successfully installs.
1. Browse for and select either the managed or unmanaged version of the *mpa_SAPProcurement* solution file downloaded in previous step.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> The template files contain two solutions. You need to install both of the same type (two unmanaged or two managed) to your prepared environment:
>
> - **SAP Base solution** contains the base Power Platform components required for the SAP Procurement solutions. The base solution also supports other SAP-related solutions that will be released later.
> - **SAP Procurement solution** contains Power Platform components specific to the procure-to-pay process domain.
