# Requirements to integrate SAP with Power Platform

Review the requirements with your team so you can identify opportunities and develop a plan of action that best suits your organization's needs.

## Power Platform licensing

Review [Power Platform licensing](/power-platform/admin/pricing-billing-skus) and ensure your organization has what it needs to proceed with an SAP + Power Platform project. Keep these points in mind:

- Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power BI premium [licensing](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/default) supports setting up and using an on-premises data gateway with premium applications, flows, and connectors (SAP ERP and Dataverse).
- The admins, developers, and functional business users who work with SAP solutions all need standalone licenses.
- The admin who's setting up the on-premises data gateway needs a [Power BI license](/power-bi/fundamentals/service-features-license-type).
- [Managed Environments](/power-platform/admin/managed-environment-licensing) is included in premium standalone licensing but is not included in the [Developer Plan](/power-platform/developer/plan).
- Admins can [view Power Apps and Power Automate consumption](/power-platform/admin/view-license-consumption-issues) in the Power Platform admin center (Note: this is a preview feature gradually being rolled out to different regions).

## SAP subscription

Work with an SAP administrator to review your existing [SAP](<https://www.sap.com/>) subscription. Keep these points in mind:
  
- The [SAP ERP connector](/connectors/saperp/) can work with any SAP system that uses RFC and BAPI calls.
- An administrator who has valid S-User access to the SAP system(s) is required to assist through the integration process. The S-User is an SAP super administrator and has all the authorizations for the portal and can manage other necessary SAP roles as necessary.
- SAP server and user accounts need to be set up to **allow actions**.

## Windows Virtual Machine

Create a [Windows Virtual Machine (VM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/products/virtual-machines/#overview) or provision a server specifically for hosting the on-premises data gateway for SAP integration with Power Platform and ensure that:

- It meets the [recommended requirements](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install#recommended) for gateway installation and management.
- You review [related considerations](/data-integration/gateway/service-gateway-install#related-considerations). For instance, if you're planning to use Windows authentication, make certain that you install the gateway on a computer that's a member of the same Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) environment as the data source.

## On-premises data gateway

Set up an on-premises data gateway on your virtual machine or server along with a Microsoft .NET Framework, a Visual C++ Redistributable, and an SAP Connector for Microsoft .NET.

The on-premises data gateway set up with the additional components on your machine or server work together to support the SAP ERP connector.

### Privileges

Be sure admins with the necessary privileges are available to coordinate and set up the on-premises data gateway along with the other components on the virtual machine or server:

- A Microsoft Entra ID Global or Gateway (default user permission for anyone performing the install) admin
- An SAP super admin (S-User)

More information: [On-premises and VNet data gateways](/data-integration/gateway/), [On-premises data gateway management for Power Platform](/power-platform/admin/onpremises-data-gateway-management), [Set up on-premises data gateway for SAP integration with Power Platform](set-up-gateway.md)

### Downloads

Go to these links to download and set up the on-premises data gateway and the additional components that support it on your machine or server:

- [Microsoft Download Center's on-premises data gateway page](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53127)

  - Select the most recent version (October 2023 - 3000.194 or higher) of the gateway to connect to [Azure Logic Apps](/azure/logic-apps/logic-apps-gateway-install), [Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/gateway-reference), and [Power Automate](/power-automate/gateway-reference)
  - Identify the operating systems and .NET Frameworks required to support the most recent version of the gateway in the _System Requirements_ section on the gateway download page
- [Microsoft .NET Framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework)

  - Select the version that supports the most recent version of the gateway
- [Microsoft C++ Runtime DLLs version 14.x](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170&preserve-view=true)
  - Select version 14.x of the library. SAP's NCo 3.1 connector requires this library to support the .NET Framework
- [SAP Connector for Microsoft .NET](https://support.sap.com/en/product/connectors/msnet.html)

  - Select the SAP NCo 3.1 connector for Microsoft .NET 3.1 (NCo 3.1) SDK from SAP
    - The specific link is in the _NCo 3.1 - compiled with .NET Framework 4.6.2_ section and looks like this: **SAP Connector for Microsoft .NET 3.1.3.0 for Windows 64 bit (x64), July 19, 2023 (ZIP archive, 35,121 KB)**

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - NCo 3.1 works with .NET Framework releases 4.6.2 to 4.8.1. Download the most recent .NET Framework listed in the _Systems Requirements_ section of the gateway download page
> - You must choose the 64-bit version, the 32-bit version will not work
> - Version NCo 3.0 is no longer supported

## Admin centers

Be sure admin centers are set up and ready to support an enterprise-level deployment. You or someone on your team need to have Global or system admin privileges to several different admin centers so you can configure and manage various components and users.

- [Microsoft 365 admin center](<https://admin.microsoft.com/>). Work with a [Microsoft 365 Global admin](/microsoft-365/admin/add-users/about-admin-roles) if you need to:

  - Update licenses, subscriptions, and services.
  - Assign high-level admin roles to your team members, such as Entra Global admin.

- [Microsoft Entra admin center](<https://entra.microsoft.com/>). As an [Entra Global admin](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator), you need to:

  - Access [Microsoft Entra ID](https://entra.microsoft.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/TenantOverview.ReactView) from the Microsoft Entra admin center.
  - Set up a new [tenant](/entra/identity-platform/quickstart-create-new-tenant) or reconfigure an existing tenant. The tenant will need to have at least 1 GB of database storage capacity available for the environments within it.
  - Set up additional [Entra ID admin roles](/entra/identity/role-based-access-control/permissions-reference#global-administrator).
  - Set up [Entra ID single sign-on (SSO) for gateway](/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-integration#azure-ad-single-sign-on-sso-for-gateway) having constrained delegation to support SSO.
  - Create [security groups](configure-security-groups.md) within the Entra ID tenant created to support conditional access to solution components.

- [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/). As a Global admin or Power Platform System admin, you need to:
  - Set up the admin center's [management and admin connectors](/power-platform/admin/wp-management-monitoring).
  - Configure the [admin center](/power-platform/admin/wp-work-with-admin-portals) so Power Platform admins can [manage](/power-platform/admin/governance-considerations#faq---what-permissions-exist-at-an-azure-ad-tenant-level) gateways, tenants, environments and user access.
  - Assign specified users Power Platform admin roles so they can monitor and manage in the admin center.
