# General error handling

Unexpected errors will occasionally occur with any enterprise software deployment and mechanisms need to be put in place to log and track such exceptions for investigation. The following summarizes where admins can view a consolidated list of unexpected errors generated from either the Power Apps or Power Automate cloud flows. See [Extend canvas apps](extend-canvas-apps.md) and [Extend cloud flows](extend-cloud-flows.md) for more information on how to handle unexpected errors.

## Monitor for app and flow errors

Unexpected errors are caught and handled within all the apps and flows using OnError and scoped action blocks that raise exceptions respectively. If raised, a new **SAP solution error** Dataverse record will be created and viewable within the **SAP Template Administrator** app. From here, an admin can view errors that are being generated and assess for common problems and corrective action.

### Steps to view solution errors

1. Open the _SAP Template Administrator_ app that was installed as part of the SAP Base solution.

2. Go to _Errors_.

3. View integration error rows with the following attributes:

| Field | Examples| Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Name | _SAP Vendor Management_, _ReadVendor_ | The name of the app or flow that generated the error. |
| Action | _Vendor Details Screen.OnVisible_, _LFAI_ | The app control or flow action step that generated the error. |
| Source Type | _Power App_, _Power Automate_ | The type of component that raised the unhandled exception. |
| Workflow Status | _Failed_, _Time Out_ | What type of exception the flow reported. |
| Generated By | | The user who experienced the error. |
| Created On | | The date and time the error was generated. |
| Error Message | | The unhandled error message raised. |
| Additional Information | | Any additional information logged, typically the JSON payload that was passed in from the app that instantiated the flow instance. |
| Workflow Instance URL | | A URL for the instance of the flow that failed that can be launched for further examination and root cause analysis. |

> [!TIP]
> Use Power Automate to create a cloud flow to trigger off of new _SAP error_ record creations in Dataverse to alert the admin or integrate with your enterprise alerting and monitoring system.

> [!TIP]
> Filter or drill into a user record associated in the _Generated By_ field to see a full history of errors that a single user might be experiencing in order to troubleshoot issues reported by an individual.
