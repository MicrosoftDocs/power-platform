# SAP Setup Assistant

The SAP Setup Assistant walks you through a checklist of manual and automated steps to help you get your Power Platform + SAP Procurement installation up and running as quickly as possible.

The Assistant is organized by stages, activities, and steps. Each stage has at least one activity with specific steps you need to complete.

The stages SAP Setup Assistant walk you through are:

- **Introduction**: Get to know the SAP Procurement template and the SAP Setup Assistant.
- **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the necessary licensing and environment setup.
- **Installation & Configuration**: Import and deploy the SAP Procurement template solution.
- **Optional activities**: Enable additional features to optimize your deployment and end-user experience.
- **Deployment and next steps**: Review the installer stages, launch the app, and explore the next steps.
  
To ensure the best chance of a successful installation and deployment of the SAP Procurement template, it's important to complete as many activity steps as possible in each stage before going to the next stage.

To avoid having to transfer downloaded files across the machines, we recommend to **run the SAP Setup Assistant on the Windows Virtual Machine** where the data gateway will be setup.
