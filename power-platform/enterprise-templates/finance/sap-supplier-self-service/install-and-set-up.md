# Install and set up the SAP Supplier Self Service template

Enterprise templates for Power Platform are solutions designed to digitally transform broad, complex business scenarios for specific lines of business or enterprise wide.

The SAP solutions are enterprise-ready and therefore need to be customized, deployed, and managed by a [centralized team](/power-platform/guidance/adoption/delivery-models#centralized) to [maintain governance and security](/power-platform/guidance/adoption/admin-best-practices).

## Prerequisites

Before you install and set up the SAP Supplier Self Service template, you need to ensure that SAP is integrated with Power Platform and that the SAP Procurement template is installed and set up in its own environment.

Take these steps to integrate SAP with Power Platform:

- [Review requirements to integrate SAP with Power Platform](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/requirements).
- [Set up environments and DLP policies](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/set-up-connections).
- [Set up an on-premises data gateway](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/set-up-gateway).
- [Configure authentication](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/configure-authentication).

Take these steps to install and set up the SAP Procurement template:

- [Install and set up the SAP Procurement solution](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/install).
- [Configure environment variables](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/configure-environment-variables).
- [Set up connections for SAP and Dataverse](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/set-up-connections).
- [Set up SAP List of Values](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/apply-seed-data#apply-saps-list-of-values). The SAP *List of Values* must be populated, otherwise the SAP Procurement and SAP Supplier Self Service solutions will not work properly.
- Enable Javascript (JS) files as attachments in your environment. Follow steps for [**Setting blocked file extensions for attachments**](/dynamics365/customer-service/administer/enable-file-attachments#configure-file-size-limit-and-file-extensions) to ensure Supplier Self Service Portal solutions do not fail during import

## Download and install

This section provides links to the SAP Supplier Self Service solution files and the guidance to manually install them into the same developer environment that contains the SAP Procurement solutions.

You have the option to download either *managed* or *unmanaged* solution files.

Whichever option you choose, be sure to download both **SAP Supplier Self Service** and **SAP Supplier Self Service Portal** solution files and then install **SAP Supplier Self Service** first.

- Managed
  - [mpa_supplier_self_service_managed](https://aka.ms/mpa_supplier_self_service_managed)
  - [SupplierSelfServicePortal_managed](https://aka.ms/SupplierSelfServicePortal_managed)
- Unmanaged
  - [mpa_supplier_self_service_unmanaged](https://aka.ms/mpa_supplier_self_service_unmanaged)
  - [SupplierSelfServicePortal_unmanaged](https://aka.ms/SupplierSelfServicePortal_unmanaged)

Once you install both solutions, select **Publish all customizations**. Be sure to [set up connections for SAP and Dataverse](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/administer/set-up-connections).

> [!NOTE]
> For the connector setup, use an SAP service-user account that is supported with the appropriate SAP licenses and permissions. All interactions corresponding to the operations done on the supplier website are done under this service-user context.

> [!TIP]
>
> Go to the [Templates-for-Power-Platform](https://aka.ms/PowerPlatformTemplateSupport) GitHub project site to log your questions or issues and get support for the SAP Procurement template.
