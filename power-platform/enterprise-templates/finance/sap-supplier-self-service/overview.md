# What is Microsoft Power Platform SAP Supplier Self Service template?

The SAP Supplier Self Service template introduces a customizable Power Pages site to complement the [SAP Procurement](/power-platform/enterprise-templates/finance/sap-procurement/overview) template. It leverages the same architecture as the SAP Procurement template utilizing Power Automate cloud flows and the SAP ERP connector for integration.
