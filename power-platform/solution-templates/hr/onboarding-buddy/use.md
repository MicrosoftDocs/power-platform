# Get started using the Onboarding Buddy app

There are three kinds of users who interact with the Onboarding Buddy app in some way:

- **Manager**. As a manager, you use the Onboarding Buddy app to match available Buddies with Onboarders within teams.
- **Buddy**. As a Buddy, you use the app to sign up as a Buddy and receive emails throughout the program.
- **Onboarder**. As an Onboarder, you're set up in the program to get matched and receive emails, but you don't use the app directly.

> [!NOTE]
> There are two admin roles that may also directly use the Onboarding Buddy app even though their primary functions are to configure and manage the app.
>
> - **Power Platform admin**. As a Power Platform admin, you install and configure the Onboarding Buddy Admin app for the Program admin and the Onboarding Buddy app for users.
> - **Program admin**. As a Program admin, you manage the Onboarding Buddy program through the Onboarding Buddy Admin app.
