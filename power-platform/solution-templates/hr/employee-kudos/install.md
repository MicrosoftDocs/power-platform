# Install the Employee Kudos template

Take the following steps to install the Employee Kudos solution template.

## Step 1: Create connections

The installation requires that three new connections be set up. It's best to create the connections before importing the solution to make the import smoother. If you create the connections during import, you have to jump back and forth between browser windows.

Create three new connections with these connectors:

- A [Microsoft Dataverse connector](/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/)
- An [Office 365 Outlook connector](/connectors/office365/)
- An [Office 365 Users connector](/connectors/office365users/)

If you want to create the connections in advance, go to _Connections_, and select **+ New Connection** in the left-side panel. Search for each connection listed in this section and create a connection.

## Step 2: Install from AppSource

Import the Kudos solution template into the environment.

1. Go to the [Kudos solution template in AppSource](<https://aka.ms/AccessEmployeeKudosTemplate>) and select **Get it now**.
1. Select the environment that you want to install the solution template into.
    :::image type="content" source="media/install/appsource-install-template.png" alt-text="Select environment":::
1. Agree to the Terms and Privacy Statements by checking the boxes.
1. Select **install**. You'll be taken to a screen where you can view the installation status.
After the installation is complete, the status shows as _Installed_.

## Step 3: Create an access team

Access team: Kudos-ReadAccessTeam
Access teams aren't, technically, a security role as defined in the Power Platform, but they play an important part in securing access rights to a Kudo. Kudo records are _owned_ by the recipient but should be readable by the sender's manager and the recipient's manager. The access team enables this by dynamically assigning the sender's manager and recipient's manager _read access_ to that Kudo through a Power Automate flow.

More information: [Use access teams and owner teams to collaborate and share information](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/use-access-teams-owner-teams-collaborate-share-information)

This application requires an access team on the Kudos table to operate properly. This access team shares each Kudos record with the sender of the Kudos and the recipient's manager. That way, these three users have access to the record:

- Recipient: Gets access to the record by owning it
- Sender: Gets access to the record by being part of the Access Team
- Recipient's manager: Gets access to the record by being part of the Access Team

If, for any reason, any other user needs access to a particular Kudos, an admin needs to add that user to the Access Team to get access automatically.
To create the Access Team:

1. Go to the [Admin Center](<https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/environments>)
1. Select the **Environment** tab and select the environment where the solution was installed.
1. Select **Settings**.
1. Select on **Templates** > **Access team templates**.
:::image type="content" source="media/install/AccessTeam2.png" alt-text="Select on Access team templates":::
1. You get redirected to the _All Team Templated_ view.
1. Select **New** on the ribbon.
1. Create a new record with the following information. It's important to use the same name as the name that the Power Automate flow uses to look up and use the Access Team.
    - Name: Kudos-ReadAccessTeam
        - Use this name as the name that the Power Automate flow uses. You can change the name, but if you do, you must also edit the flow.
    - Entity: Kudo
    - Description: The team to share with the sender of Kudos and the kudos recipient's manager
1. Set _Access Rights_ to _Read_.
1. Select **Save** and close this window.

## Step 4: Assign security roles to users

The solution includes three new security roles:

- **Kudos – Program Admin**
  - A program admin can see all Kudos.
  - Users in this role act as the administrator of the Kudos program. This security role grants access to the canvas app as a regular user and access to the model-driven app where an admin can view all Kudos, create new Kudos _Types_, add users to the _Opt-out User_ list, and delete and deactivate Kudos and _Opt-out User_ records.
  - Assign this role to users that manage the Kudos program in your organization.
- **Kudos – Manager**
  - A manager has access to see their own Kudos, and the Kudos their direct reports have received.
  - This security role grants access to the canvas app, where users can see their own _sent_ and _received_ Kudos, send new Kudos, and see the Kudos received by employees they currently manage. This security role doesn't grant _delete_ or _deactivate_ access.
  - Assign this role to those users who manage employees.
- **Kudos –Employee**
  - An employee has access to see the Kudos they have both sent and received.
  - This security role grants access to the canvas app, where users can see their own sent and received Kudos and send new ones.
  - Assign this role to regular users that need access to send and receive Kudos.

> [!NOTE]
> All users must also be assigned the _Basic User_ role in addition to any other roles assigned to them.

Roles can be assigned from the Admin Center.

1. Go to [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/)

1. Select on the **Environment** tab and select the environment where the solution was installed.
1. Select on **Users** > **See all**.
1. Select the users, select **Manage security roles** and select the appropriate roles.
1. Select **Save**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
>Be sure to also add the **Basic User** security role in addition to other Kudos-specific roles.

## Step 5: Assign _run-only_ access to flows

Set up a new or use an existing security group that represents all users who use the Kudos App so that the flows can run for all users.

There are two cloud flows that require configuration of run-only access:

- Kudo App – Share Kudo with Sender, Assign to Recipient
- Kudos App – Notification Email

Follow these steps for each flow:

1. Go to the Kudos solution and open the flow.
1. In the bottom-right, there's a section called _Run only users_. Select **Edit**. The _Manage run-only permissions_ screen pops up:

     :::image type="content" source="media/install/RunOnly2.png" alt-text="Manage run-only permissions":::

1. In the top box labeled _Invite system users or teams_, enter the security group you want to use that contains all Kudos users.
1. Select **Save**.

## Step 6: Set flow connections

1. Open the Kudos solution template solution by selecting on **Kudos solution template** in the solutions tab.

1. Inside the _Kudos solution template_, go to _Cloud Flows_. There are two cloud flows that require editing:

    - **Kudo app**: Share Kudo with sender, assign to recipient
    - **Kudos app**: Notification email
1. Edit the _Kudo app_ by taking these steps:
    1. Select on the flow to open up a flow overview page.
    1. Select **Edit** in the top-left corner.
    1. Select **Continue**.
    1. Select **Save**.
1. Edit the _Kudos app_ by taking these steps:
    1. Go to _Cloud Flows_ in the Kudos solution.
    1. Select on the flow to open up a flow overview page.
    1. Select **Edit** in the top-left corner.
    1. Select on the first flows step with a warning sign-on it.
    1. Select on **+ New connection reference** or if pre-existing connections are listed, you can select on one of those to reuse it. After you do that, the warning should resolve and you'll see the flow step without the warning. Note: after selecting, it may take a few seconds for everything to resolve.
    1. Select on the next flow step with a warning on it.
    1. Select on **+ New connection reference** or if pre-existing connections are listed, you can select on one of those to reuse it. After you do that, the warning should resolve and you'll see the flow step without the warning. It may take a few seconds for everything to resolve.
    :::image type="content" source="media/install/SetFlow12.png" alt-text="Create new connection reference":::
    1. Select **Save** at the bottom of the screen or at the top toolbar.

## Step 7: Set Cloud Flows to _On_

Open the newly installed _Kudos solution template_ and verify that the four cloud flows are set to the _on_ status. If they aren't, turn them on.

1. Select the cloud flow that is turned off.
1. Select **Turn on** on the top toolbar.

## Step 8: Install sample data (optional)

Sample data along with installation instructions are available on GitHub at this link: [Kudos Sample Data](https://aka.ms/KudosSampleData).

To create your own badges, refer to [Create Custom Badges](use.md#create-custom-kudos-types).

## Step 9: Share the App

1. In the environment that Kudos is installed, select **Apps**.
1. Locate the _Kudos App_. Note: If you did not install the Kudos solution and it has not been shared with you, then you will have to navigate into the Kudos solution and find the app there.
1. Select the _three dots_ to the right of the Kudos app and select **Share**.
1. Search for and add the users who you want to share the app with.
    - For users that should have access to edit the app, check the _Co-owner_ box.
    - For regular users of the app, leave that checkbox empty.
    - If everyone in the organization should be able to use the app, you can look for _Everyone_ in the _Enter a name_ box.
1. In the _Data permission_ area, you can select roles from a drop-down list. It's next to the Microsoft Dataverse tables that the Kudos app uses. Be sure to select the correct Kudos role (Employee, Manager, Program Admin) along with _Basic User_.
1. Add an optional email message.
1. Select **Share**.

## Step 10: Turn on Auditing (optional)

While this isn't required, we recommend enabling the audit setting on the system, so it's easy to see who created/updated records in the future.
To do this:

1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
1. Select **Environment** tab, select the environment where the solution is installed, and select **Audit settings**.
