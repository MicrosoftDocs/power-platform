# Get started using the Awards and Recognition app

As a user, use the Awards and Recognition app to submit nominations to recognize individual coworkers and teams, view your own recognitions, and update your user settings.

Some users also have the ability to update the apps language setting if the **Employee Experience Localizer** security role is assigned to them by a Power Platform admin.

## Nominate coworkers for awards

Submit nominations that recognize your coworkers for outstanding efforts in your organization and view your own recognitions that you receive in the Awards and Recognition app.
