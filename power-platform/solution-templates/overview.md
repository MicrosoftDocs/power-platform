# What are solution templates for Power Platform?

Solution templates for Power Platform are solutions built on [Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/). The solution templates are designed to drive productivity and operational efficiencies within specific lines of business or enterprise-wide. Aligned to specific use cases and outcomes, they accelerate time to value by digitizing new processes or extending upon existing major technology investments, such as an enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), or human resource (HR) systems.

Power Platform solution templates require premium licensing and are built for centralized teams to install and extend upon locally. You can organize an internal information technology (IT) and  business operations team or select an external partner team to implement the Power Platform template solution project.

## What are the benefits?

Implementing enterprise software use cases can be time consuming and expensive. Solution templates for Microsoft Power Platform provide a foundation for you to work with and build upon so you can quickly extend and deploy. In turn, by continuing to use the full potential of Power Platform, the solution templates can be further extended to connect workflows across more systems of record and digitize manually intensive processes.

The solution templates enable you to:

- **Time to Value**
  - Remove much of the upfront investments needed in traditional enterprise software development
  - Reduce sets of resources and skills needed to deploy
  - Gain new business insights through digitized and connected processes

- **Maximize Existing IT Investments**
  - Continue to drive value out of existing major IT investments like ERP, CRM, and HCM
  - Maintain systems of record and data sources of truth

- **Productivity**
  - Reduce inefficiencies in current manual processes
  - Connect data across multiple systems of record to complete a workflow
  - Meet users where they are whether in Teams or other collaborative experiences
