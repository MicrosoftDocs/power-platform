# Solution templates for Power Platform

Solution templates for [Power Platform](/power-platform/) are solutions that serve as starting points for specific use cases and outcomes. They accelerate time to value by allowing you to quickly digitize new processes or extend your technology investments in enterprise resource planning (ERP), customer relationship management (CRM), and human resource (HR) systems.

Solution templates are built for centralized teams to install and extend locally. You can organize an internal information technology (IT) and business operations team or select an external partner team to implement a Power Platform template solution project.

The solution templates help you:

- See how your system's data can be easily accessed and organized in a streamlined view in a series of canvas Power Apps.
- Realize how workflows can be automated by Power Automate cloud flows operating behind the scenes.

Additionally, you can:

- Customize your solutions.
- Integrate your system of record with other features, applications, and systems.
- Incorporate other controls over how your users interact with data.

Power Platform solution templates require premium licensing.

## Benefits of solution templates

Implementing enterprise software use cases can be time-consuming and expensive. Solution templates for Power Platform provide a foundation for you to start from.
