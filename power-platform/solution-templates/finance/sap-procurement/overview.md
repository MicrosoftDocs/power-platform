# SAP procurement solution template for Power Platform

SAP ERP is a centralized system of record that facilitates the management of data and business processes between many departments within an organization. This complex system of record serves as the primary enterprise resource planning application for many businesses worldwide.

Microsoft Power Platform can transform the way you view and work with your SAP data. The SAP procurement solution template for Power Platform helps you get started.

## Get to know the SAP procurement template

The SAP procurement solution template accelerates the integration of data between SAP and Power Platform to drive efficiencies in your procure-to-pay processesâ€”specifically, vendor management, requisition management, and purchase order management. It is published by Microsoft on AppSource and is supported on GitHub.

You can access the solution templates on AppSource at: <https://aka.ms/AccessSAPProcurementTemplate>

The SAP procurement solution template consists of the following two solutions that layer onto themselves:

- **SAP Base** contains base components used by the SAP procurement solution template and future SAP solution templates.
- **SAP Procurement** contains components that help transform your procure-to-pay business processes connected to SAP.

> [!IMPORTANT]
