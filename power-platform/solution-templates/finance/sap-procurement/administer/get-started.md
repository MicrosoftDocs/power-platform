# Get started with SAP Procurement solution template

Power Platform solution templates published by Microsoft on AppSource are designed to digitally transform broad, complex business scenarios for specific lines of business or enterprise wide.

It's important to establish a defined, centralized team that consists of key stakeholders, business analysts, Power Platform administrators and developers, and SAP admins (S-User) and functional analysts (SAP BASIS).

Your team can get started by reviewing the steps in each phase of the administration journey.

## Integrate SAP with Power Platform

Review your organization's current [Power Platform administration and governance](/power-platform/guidance/adoption/admin-best-practices) with your team. Develop a plan of action that supports your organization's deployment of enterprise-scale solutions on Power Platform.

| Step | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Review requirements](requirements.md) | Review the requirements necessary to set up SAP integration with Power Platform and install the SAP Procurement solution template to your development environment |
| [Set up environments and data policies](set-up-connections.md) | Develop an environment strategy that supports solution application lifecycle management (ALM) and create data policies to govern access |
| [Set up on-premises data gateway](set-up-gateway.md) | Set up an on-premises data gateway to ensure secure data transfer between on-premises data and Microsoft cloud services |
| [Configure authentication](configure-authentication.md) | Configure how to authenticate to your SAP instance via one of the supported methods |
| [Install solutions](install.md) | Access and install the solutions files into your environment |
| [Set up connections](set-up-connections.md) | Set up connection components to be used by the flows and apps |
| [Configure environment variables](configure-environment-variables.md) | Configure environment variables used by the cloud flows to integrate with SAP and support a healthy ALM strategy |

## Administer the apps and monitor health

Work with your the IT administrator and SAP functional analyst to administrate key items that help control access to the apps, seed data stored in Dataverse, and monitor for functional health.

| Steps                                                                                                                   | Description                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [Configure Azure Active Directory (AAD) security groups](configure-security-groups.md) | Control access to solutions and components |
| [Administer seed data](apply-seed-data.md)                                                                               | Import and create data used by the flows and apps to integrate with SAP          |
| [Monitor for errors](monitor-errors.md)                                                                             | See and investigate unhandled exceptions generated from either the flows or apps |

## Extend to meet your local business requirements

Work with your SAP functional analyst, business subject matter expert (SME) and Power Platform developers to customize the solution so it supports your organization's unique business processes.

| Step | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Customize your solutions](customize-solutions.md) | Start your local configurations by adding desired components from the SAP Procurement solution template to an unmanaged solution in your development environment |
| [Extend canvas apps](extend-canvas-apps.md) | Add new SAP fields, apply custom themes, localize and connect your SAP data with additional sources and processes|
| [Extend model driven app and Dataverse tables](extend-model-apps-dataverse.md) | Create additional tables, columns, security roles to help drive and persist newly digitized data that is currently not mastered and extend the administrator experience |
| [Extend cloud flows](extend-cloud-flows.md) | Map new SAP fields and connect into additional processes and workflows|
