    participant Data as Plain Data
    participant AES as AES-256-CBC
    participant HMAC as HMACSHA256
    participant Encrypted as Encrypted Data
    
    Data->>AES: Apply AES-256 in CBC mode
    AES->>HMAC: Output ciphertext
    HMAC->>HMAC: Generate authentication code with SHA-256
    HMAC->>Encrypted: Append authentication code to ciphertext
    
    Note over Data,Encrypted: Decryption process
    
    Encrypted->>HMAC: Verify authentication code
    HMAC->>AES: Pass authenticated ciphertext
    AES->>Data: Decrypt to plaintext
