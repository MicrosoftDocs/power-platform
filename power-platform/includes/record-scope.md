Fields of the record currently being processed are available within the formula.  Use the [**ThisRecord** operator](../power-fx/operators.md#thisitem-thisrecord-and-as-operators) or simply reference fields by name as you would any other value. The [**As** operator](../power-fx/operators.md#thisitem-thisrecord-and-as-operators) can also be used to name the record being processed which can help make your formula easier to understand and make nested records accessible. For more information, see the examples below and [working with record scope](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-tables#record-scope).
