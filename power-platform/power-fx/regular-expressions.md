# Regular expressions

The [**IsMatch**, **Match**, and **MatchAll** functions](reference/function-ismatch.md) are used to extract and validate patterns in text. The pattern they use is called a [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression). 

Regular expressions are powerful and used for a wide variety of purposes. They can also look like a random sequence of punctuation marks. This article doesn't describe all aspects of regular expressions, but a wealth of information, tutorials, and tools are available online.

Regular expressions have a long history and are available in many programming languages. Every programming language has its own dialect of regular expressions and there are few standards. As much as possible, we're striving to have the same regular expression give the same result across all Power Fx implementations. Compatibility isn't easy to accomplish as Power Fx runs on top of JavaScript and .NET which have significant differences. To accommodate running on different platforms, Power Fx regular expressions are limited to a subset of features that are widely supported across the industry.

As a result, some regular expressions that may work in other environments may be blocked or require a tweak in Power Fx. Authoring time errors are reported as unsupported features are encountered. This is one of the reasons that the regular expression and options must be an authoring time constant and not dynamic (for example, provided in a variable).

> [!NOTE]
> Power Apps uses an earlier version of Power Fx regular expressions which has fewer limitations but also fewer features. **MatchOptions.DotAll** and **MatchOptions.FreeSpacing** aren't available and the definitions of **Match.Email** and **Match.Hyphen** are different. Unicode surrogate pairs aren't treated as a single character. **MatchOptions.NumberedSubMatches** is the default. The version of regular expressions described here will be available in Power Apps soon, under a "Power Fx V1.0 compatibility" switch.

## Supported features

Power Fx supports the following regular expression features, with notes on how Power Fx behavior may differ from other systems.

The regular expression must be a constant and not calculated or stored in a variable. Using the `&` operator, string interpolation `$"{...}"`, and the `Concatenate`, `Char`, and `UniChar` functions with constant arguments is supported.

### Literal characters

| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Literal characters | Any Unicode character can be inserted directly, except `\`, `[`, `]`, `^`, `$`, `.`, `|`, `?`, `*`, `+`, `(`, `)`, `{`, and `}`. When using **MatchOptions.FreeSpacing**, `#`, ` `, and other `\s` space characters must be escaped as they have a different meaning. |
| Escaped literal characters | `\` (backslash) followed by one of the direct literal characters, such as `\?` to insert a question mark. `\#` and `\ ` may also be used even when **MatchOptions.FreeSpacing** is disabled for consistency. | 
| Hexadecimal and Unicode character codes | `\x20` with exactly two hexadecimal digits, `\u2028` with exactly four hexadecimal digits and can be used for high and low surrogates. |
| Unicode code point | `\u{01F47B}` with up to eight hexadecimal digits. Must be in the range 0 to U+10FFFF and can't be used for either a high or low surrogate. May result in a surrogate pair (two characters) if greater than U+FFFF. |
| Carriage return | `\r`, the same as `Char(13)`. |
| Newline character | `\n`, the same as `Char(10)`. |
| Form feed | `\f`, the same as `Char(12)`. |
| Horizontal Tab | `\t`, the same as `Char(9)`. |

Octal codes for characters, such as `\044` or `\o{044}` are disallowed, as they can be ambiguous with numbered back references. Use `\x` or `\u` instead. 

`\v` isn't supported as it ambiguous across regular expression languages. Use `\x0b` for a vertical tab or `[\x0b\f\r\n\x85\u2028\u2029]` for vertical whitespace.

### Assertions

Assertions match a particular position in the text, but don't consume any characters.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Start of line | `^`, matches the beginning of the text, or of a line if **MatchOptions.Multiline** is used. |
| End of line | `$`, matches the end of the text, or of a line if **MatchOptions.Multiline** is used. |
| Lookahead | `(?=a)` and `(?!a)`, matches ahead for a pattern.
| Lookbehind | `(?<=b)` and `(?<!b)`, matches behind for a pattern.
| Word breaks | `\b` and `\B`, using the Unicode definition of letters `[\p{Ll}\p{Lu}\p{Lt}\p{Lo}\p{Nd}\p{Pc}\p{Lm}]`. |

`$` matches the end of a line, including any trailing `\r\n`, `\r`, or `\n`.

Lookahead and lookbehind assertions can't contain submatches or unlimited quantifiers within, and can't be used with a quantifier outside. 

### Character classes

| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Dot | `.`, matches everything except `\r` and `\n` unless **MatchOptions.DotAll** is used. |
| Character class | `[abc]` list of characters, `[a-fA-f0-9]` range of characters, `[^a-z]` everything but these characters. Character classes can't be nested, subtracted, or intersected, and many punctuation marks may not appear twice in a row (`@@`, `%%`, `!!`, etc). |  
| Word characters | `\w` and `\W` using the Unicode definition of letters `[\p{Ll}\p{Lu}\p{Lt}\p{Lo}\p{Nd}\p{Pc}\p{Lm}]`. `\W` can't be used in a negative character class.|
| Digit characters | `\d` includes the digits `0` to`9` and `\p{Nd}`, `\D` matches everything except characters matched by `\d`. `\D` can't be used in a negative character class.|
| Space characters | `\s` includes spacing characters `[ \t\n\x0b\f\r\x85\u2028\u2029\p{Z}]`, `\S` which matches everything except characters matched by `\s`. `\S` can't be used in a negative character class.|
| Unicode character category | `\p{Ll}` matches all Unicode lowercase letters, while `\P{Ll}` matches everything that isn't a Unicode lowercase letter. `\P{}` can't be used in a negative character class. |

To increase clarity and avoid ambiguity, square bracket character classes are more restrictive than in other regular expression languages:
- Literal hyphen characters must be escaped. Use `[\-a]` instead of `[-a]` to match `-` or `a`.
- Beginning square brackets must be escaped. Use `[\[a]` instead of `[[]` to match `[` or `a`.
- Unless it's the first character and indicating negation, the character must be escaped. Use `[a\^]` instead of `[a^]` to match `^` or `a`.
- Curly braces must be escaped. Use `[\{\}]` to match `{` or `}`.
- Empty character class `[]` isn't supported. To include a closing square bracket in a character class, escape it.

Unicode character categories supported by `\p{}` and `\P{}`:
- Letters: `L`, `Lu`, `Ll`, `Lt`, `Lm`, `Lo`
- Marks: `M`, `Mn`, `Mc`, `Me`
- Numbers: `N`, `Nd`, `Nl`, `No`
- Punctuation: `P`, `Pc`, `Pd`, `Ps`, `Pe`, `Pi`, `Pf`, `Po`
- Symbols: `S`, `Sm`, `Sc`, `Sk`, `So`
- Separators: `Z`, `Zs`, `Zl`, `Zp`
- Control and Format: `Cc`, `Cf`, while other `C` prefix categories aren't supported.

`\W`, `\D`, `\S`, and `\P{}` can't be used within a negated character class `[^...]`. In order to be implemented on some platforms, these negative character classes are translated to their Unicode equivalents which could be difficult to do if also negated.

Unicode characters between U+10000 and U+10FFFF, requiring surrogate pairs, aren't supported in character classes.

### Quantifiers

| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Greedy zero or one | `?` matches zero or one time, with as *large* a match as possible. |
| Greedy zero or more | `*` matches zero or more times, with as *large* a match as possible. |
| Greedy one or more | `+` matches one or more times, with as *large* a match as possible. |
| Greedy at least n | `{n,}` matches at least *n* times, with as *large* a match as possible. For example, `a{3,}` matches all the characters in `aaaaa`. |
| Greedy between n and m | `{n,m}` matches between *n* and *m* times, with as *large* a match as possible. For example, `a{1,3}` matches the first three characters of `aaaaa`. |
| Lazy zero or one | `??` matches zero or one time, with as *small* a match as possible. |
| Lazy zero or more | `*?` matches zero or more times, with as *small* a match as possible. |
| Lazy one or more | `+?` matches one or more times, with as *small* a match as possible. |
| Lazy at least n | `{n,}?` matches at least *n* times, with as *small* a match as possible. For example, `a{3,}?` matches only the first three characters in `aaaaa`. |
| Lazy between n and m | `{n,m}?` matches between *n* and *m* times, with as *small* a match as possible. For example, `a{1,3}?` matches only the first character of `aaaaa`. |
| Exact n | `{n}` matches *n* times, exactly. For example, `a{3}` matches exactly three characters of `aaaaa`. |

Possessive quantifiers aren't supported.

Mixing sub-matches and quantifiers has limitations. For more information, see [Possibly empty sub-matches](#possibly-empty-submatches).

### Groups

| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Group | `(` and `)` are used to group elements for quantifiers to be applied. For example, `(abc)+` matches `abcabc`. |
| Alternation | `a|b` matches "a" or "b", often used in a group. |
| Named submatch and back reference | `(?<name>chars)` captures a submatch with the name `name`, referenced with `\k<name>`. can't be used if **MatchOptions.NumberedSubMatches** is enabled. |
| Numbered submatch and back reference | When **MatchOptions.NumberedSubMatches** is enabled, `(a)` captures a submatch referenced with `\1`. |
| Noncapture group | `(?:a)`, creates group without capturing the result as a named or numbered submatch. All groups are non-capturing unless **MatchOptions.NumberedSubMatches** is enabled. |

Named and numbered submatches can't be used together. By default, named submatches are enabled and are preferred for clarity and maintainability, while standard capture groups become non capture groups with improved performance. This behavior can be changed with **MatchOptions.NumberedSubMatches** which provides for traditional capture groups but disables named capture groups. Some implementations treat a mix of numbered and named capture groups differently which is why Power Fx disallows it. 

Self referencing capture groups aren't supported, for example the regular expression `(a\1)`.

Two capture groups can't share the same name, for example, the regular expression `(?<id>\w+)|(?<id>\d+)` isn't supported.

The name of a named submatch must begin with a `\p{L}` character or `_`, and can continue with those characters plus `\p{Nd}`. Names are limited in length to 62 UTF-16 code units.

Backreferences to possibly empty submatches and to submatches within a look behind or look ahead are also not supported. 

Some implementations offer an "explicit capture" option to improve performance which is unnecessary in Power Fx as it's the default. **MatchOptions.NumberedSubMatches** disables it and enables implicitly numbered captures.

Mixing submatches and quantifiers has limitations. See [Possibly empty submatches](#possibly-empty-submatches) for more information.

### Comments

| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Inline comments | `(?# comment here)`, which is ignored as a comment. Comment ends with the next close parenthesis, even if an opening parenthesis is in the comment.|

See **MatchOptions.FreeSpacing** for an alternative for formatting and commenting regular expressions.

### Inline options

| Feature | Description |
|---------|---------|
| Inline options | `(?im)` is the same as using **MatchOptions.IgnoreCase** and **MatchOptions.Multiline**. Must be set at the beginning of the regular expression. |

Supported inline modes are `[imsx]`, corresponding to **MatchOptions.IgnoreCase**, **MatchOptions.Multiline**, **MatchOptions.DotAll**, and **MatchOptions.FreeSpacing**, respectively. `n` is also accepted for compatibility but has no effect as it is the default and is incompatible with **MatchOptions.NumberedSubMatches**.

Inline options can't be used to disable an option or set an option for a subexpression.

## Options

Match options change the behavior of regular expression matching. There are two ways to enable options, which can be mixed so long as there's no conflict:
- **MatchOptions** enum value passed as the third argument to **Match**, **MatchAll**, and **IsMatch**.  Options can be combined with the `&` operator or `Concatenate` function, for example `MatchOptions.DotAll & MatchOptions.FreeSpacing`. All of the regular expression functions require that **MatchOptions** is a constant value, it can't be calculated or stored in a variable. 
- `(?...)` prefix at the very beginning of the regular expression.  Options can be combined with multiple letters in the `(?...)` construct, for example `(?sx)`.  Some options don't have a `(?...)` equivalent but may have other ways to get the same effect, for example **MatchOptions.BeginsWith** is the equivalent of `^` at the beginning of the regular expression.

### Contains

Enabled with **MatchOptions.Contains** without a regular expression text equivalent. **MatchOptions.Contains** is the default for all functions outside of Power Apps; within Power Apps **MatchOptions.Complete** is the default for **IsMatch**.

### Complete

Enabled with **MatchOptions.Complete** or use `^` and `$` at the beginning and of the regular expression, respectively.

### BeginsWith

Enabled with **MatchOptions.BeginsWith** or use `^` at the beginning and of the regular expression.

### EndsWith

Enabled with **MatchOptions.EndsWith** or use `$` at the end of the regular expression.

### DotAll

Enabled with **MatchOptions.DotAll** or `(?s)` at the start of the regular expression.

Normally the dot `.` operator matches all characters except newline characters `[\n\x0b\f\r\x85\u2028\u2029]`. With the **DotAll** modifier, all characters are matched, including newlines.

In this example, only the "Hello" is matched as by default the `.` won't match the newline:

```powerapps-dot
Trim( Match( "Hello
              World", ".*" ).FullMatch )
// returns 
// "Hello"
```

But if we add the **DotAll** modifier, then the newline and all subsequent characters are matched:

```powerapps-dot
Trim( Match( "Hello
              World", ".*", MatchOptions.DotAll ).FullMatch )
// returns 
// "Hello
// World"
```

### FreeSpacing

Enabled with **MatchOptions.FreeSpacing** or `(?x)` at the start of a regular expression.

Free spacing makes it easier to read and maintain a complex regular expression. The rules are simple:
- Space characters are ignored in the regular expression, including all characters that would match `\s`. If matching a space is desired, use `\s`, `\ `, `\t`, `\r`, or `\n`.
- `#` begins a comment which runs until the end of the line. It and all characters that follow up to the next newline character (characters not matched by `.` without **MatchOptions.DotAll**) are ignored.
- Characters classes aren't included in these changes. Space characters and `#` act as they normally do. For example, `IsMatch( "a#b c", "(?x)a[ #]b[ #]c" )` returns *true*. Some regular expression languages include character classes in free spacing, or provide an option to include them, but Power Fx doesn't.

For example, here is a complex regular expression for matching an ISO [8601 date time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601):

```powerapps-dot
IsMatch( 
    "2025-01-17T19:38:49+0000",
    "^\d{4}-(0\d|1[012])-([012]\d|3[01])(T([01]\d|2[0123]):[0-5]\d(:[0-5]\d(\.\d{3})?)?(Z|[\-+]\d{4}))?$"
)
// returns true
```

And here is the identical regular expression with free spacing utilizing multiple lines, indentation for groups, and regular expression comments, making this version easier to understand, validate, and maintain.

```powerapps-dot
IsMatch( "2025-01-17T19:38:49+0000", 
    "(?x)                 # enables free spacing, must be very first
    ^                     # matches from beginning of text
    \d{4}                 # year (0000-9999)
    -(0\d|1[012])         # month (00-12)
    -([012]\d|3[01])      # day (00-31, range not checked against month)
    (T([01]\d|2[0123])    # optional time, starting with hours (00-23)
      :[0-5]\d            # minutes (00-59)
      (:[0-5]\d           # optional seconds (00-59)
        (\.\d{3})?        # optional milliseconds (000-999)
      )?
      (Z|[\-+]\d{4})      # time zone
    )?
    $                     # matches to end of text
    "
)
// returns true
```

### IgnoreCase

Enabled with **MatchOptions.IgnoreCase** or `(?i)` at the start of a regular expression.

Matches text in a letter case insensitive: upper case letters match lower case letters and lower case letters match upper case letters. 

For example:

```powerapps-dot
IsMatch( "HELLO!", "hello", MatchOptions.IgnoreCase )
// returns true

IsMatch( "file://c:/temp/info.txt", "^FILE://", MatchOptions.IgnoreCase )
// returns true
```

Most parts or Power Fx are culture aware, but not here. Using culture invariant matching is the industry standard for regular expressions, including in JavaScript and Perl. It's useful in the second example where a system resource is being matched, in for example, the `tr-TR` culture where `I` isn't the uppercase equivalent of `i`.

If a culture aware, case insensitive match is needed, use characters class with the matching characters instead, for example `[Hh][Ee][Ll][Ll][Oo]` for the first example.

### Multiline

Enabled with **MatchOptions.Multiline** or `(?m)` at the start of a regular expression.

Normally, `^` and `$` anchors match the beginning and of the input text. With the **Multiline** modifier, these anchors match the beginning and end of lines in the input text, where each line ends with `\r`, `\n`, `\r\n`, or the end of the input.  For example:

```powerapps-dot
MatchAll( "Hello" & Char(13) & Char(10) & "World", "^.+$" )
// returns 
// "Hello"
```

## Predefined patterns

Predefined patterns provide a simple way to match either one of a set of characters or a sequence of multiple characters. Use the [string-concatenation operator **&**](operators.md) to combine your own text strings with members of the **Match** enum:

| Match enum            | Description                                                                                              | Regular expression    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Any**               | Matches any character.                                                                                   | `.`                   |
| **Comma**             | Matches a comma `,`.                                                                                         | `,`                   |
| **Digit**             | Matches a single digit (`0` through `9` and other members of `\p{Nd}`).                                                                | `\d`                  |
| **Email**             | Matches an email address that contains an "at" symbol (`@`) and a domain name that contains at least one dot (`.`), delimited by whitespace and punctuation characters. | *see note*            |
| **Hyphen**            | Matches a hyphen.                                                                                        | `-` *see note*        |
| **LeftParen**         | Matches a left parenthesis `(`.                                                                          | `\(`                  |
| **Letter**            | Matches a letter.                                                                                        | `\p{L}`               |
| **MultipleDigits**    | Matches one or more digits.                                                                              | `\d+`                 |
| **MultipleLetters**   | Matches one or more letters.                                                                             | `\p{L}+`              |
| **MultipleNonSpaces** | Matches one or more characters that don't add whitespace (not space, tab, or newline).                   | `\S+`                 |
| **MultipleSpaces**    | Matches one or more characters that add whitespace (space, tab, or newline).                             | `\s+`                 |
| **NonSpace**          | Matches a single character that doesn't add whitespace.                                                  | `\S`                  |
| **OptionalDigits**    | Matches zero, one, or more digits.                                                                       | `\d*`                 |
| **OptionalLetters**   | Matches zero, one, or more letters.                                                                      | `\p{L}*`              |
| **OptionalNonSpaces** | Matches zero, one, or more characters that don't add whitespace.                                         | `\S*`                 |
| **OptionalSpaces**    | Matches zero, one, or more characters that add whitespace.                                               | `\s*`                 |
| **Period**            | Matches a period or dot `.`.").                                                                           | `\.`                  |
| **RightParen**        | Matches a right parenthesis `)`.                                                                         | `\)`                  |
| **Space**             | Matches a character that adds whitespace.                                                                | `\s`                  |
| **Tab**               | Matches a tab character.                                                                                 | `\t`                  |

For example, the pattern **"A" & Match.MultipleDigits** matches the letter "A" followed by one or more digits.

The **Match.Email** is more complicated than the rest. It's designed to detect and extract common email address of the form **local@hostname.tld**, possibly from a long passages of text, supporting international characters and emojis. Use it to validate a form that takes an email address as an input, as a quick test that the input is in an email form. If not extracting, use **MatchOptions.Complete** to detect an email address in for example a text input control.

However, **Match.Email** doesn't validate that the email address conforms to all of the many evolving standards for email addresses, domain names, and top-level-domains which would require a complicated regular expression that would need to be updated from time to time. Although most email addresses are treated as one would expect, **Match.Email** matches some things which aren't legal, for example, an underscore in the hostname, and not match some that are legal, for example, quoted email addresses or IP addresses. If needed, there are many regular expressions on the web for detecting a truly legal email address. Always test your regular expression for your specific needs before using in production.

If you want to see the regular expression used, evaluate the formula `Text( Match.Email )`. The first part matches the characters before the `@` and excludes common ASCII punctuation as per [RFC 822 and revisions](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc822.html#section-3.3) and Unicode beginning and ending punctuation for easier extraction, such as `(`, `[`, `“`, `«`, and `「`. It doesn't support the uncommon and discouraged use of quoted strings or comments. Following the `@`, the second and third parts of the regular expression are the same and separated by a `.`, ensuring that there's always at least one `.` in the address. These parts exclude all Unicode punctuation except for `.`, `-`, and `_`. IP addresses aren't supported. Throughout the entire email address, international characters and emojis are supported.

In Power Apps, when not using Power Fx 1.0, **Match.Email** and **Match.Hyphen** have slightly different definitions. **Match.Email** is simpler, but isn't suitable for extracting an email address as it capture spaces. Previously, **Match.Hyphen** was escaped outside of a character class which is now illegal.

### NumberedSubMatches

Enabled with **MatchOptions.NumberedSubMatches** with no inline option. `(?n)` is supported as the opposite of this option for compatibility and is the default.

By default, `(...)` doesn't capture, the equivalent of what most systems call "explicit capture." To capture, use a named capture with `(?<name>...)` with backreference `\k<name>`. Using named captures improves performance by not capturing groups that aren't needed, improving clarity by using names, and not prone to errors if the position of captures changes.

If you have an existing regular expression, it may depend on groups being captured automatically and numbered, including numbered back references. This behavior is available by using the **MatchOptions.NumberedSubMatches** option.

Named and numbered submatches can't be used together. Some implementations treat a mix of numbered and named capture groups differently which is why Power Fx disallows it. 

## Possibly empty submatches

As stated in the introduction, Power Fx's regular expressions are intentionally limited to features that can be consistently implemented on top of .NET, JavaScript, and other programming language regular expression engines. Authoring time errors prevent the use of features that aren't a part of this set. 

One area that can be different between implementations is how empty submatches are handled. For example, consider the regular expression `(?<submatch>a*)+` asked to match the text `a`. On .NET, the submatch results in an empty text string, while on JavaScript it results in `a`. Both can be argued as correct implementations, as the `+` quantifier can be satisfied with an empty string since the contents of the group has a `*` quantifier.

To avoid different results across Power Fx implementations, submatches that could be empty can't be used with a quantifier. Here are examples of how a submatch could be empty:

| Examples | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `(?<submatch>a{0,}b*)+` | All of the contents of the submatch are optional and so the entire submatch may be empty. |
| `((<submatch>a)?b)+` | Due to the `?` outside the submatch, the submatch as a whole is optional. |
| `(?<submatch>a|b*)+` | Alternation within the submatch with something that could be empty could result in the entire submatch being empty. |
| `((?<submatch>a)|b)+` | Alternation outside the submatch could match `b` in which case the submatch would be empty.|

The submatch in `(?<submatch>a+)+` can't be empty, as there must be at least one `a` in he submatch, and is supported.

## Unicode

Power Fx regular expressions use Unicode categories for the definitions of `\w`, `\d`, and `\s`, with specific categories available through `\p{..}`.

There can be some variation in these definitions across platforms. For example, the Unicode standard is updated from time to time with new characters which will later be implemented by platforms at their own pace. Variations of results between platforms on these character changes can be expected until all platforms are updated.

Power Fx regular expressions ensure that category information is always available for the Basic Multilingual Plane (characters U+0 to U+ffff). Some platforms don't implement categories for characters in the Supplementary Multilingual Plane and beyond (U+10000 through U+10ffff). This limitation is usually not a concern as characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane are the most commonly used. Consider using character values directly instead of categories if your scenario involves characters at or beyond U+10000. It's always a good idea to test your regular expressions on the platforms you intend to use.

There can also be small edge case differences between platforms. For example, some platforms may not see `ſ` as matching `s` when **MatchOptions.IgnoreCase** is invoked. If these characters are important for your scenario, use a character class such as `[ſsS]` to match in a case insensitive manner that explicitly includes the characters desired.
