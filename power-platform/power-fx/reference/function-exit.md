# Exit function in Power Apps

Exits the currently running app and optionally signs out the current user.

## Description

The **Exit** function exits the currently running app. The user is returned to the list of apps. The user can then select another app to open.

**Exit** stops any further formula evaluation. Any function calls chained with a [semicolon operator](operators.md) after the **Exit** aren't carried out.

Use the optional _Signout_ argument to sign the current user out of Power Apps. _Signout_ is useful when devices are shared to ensure user security.

While authoring the app, calling **Exit** doesn't exit or sign out the user. However, it stops the evaluation of the rest of the formula.

**Exit** can only be used in [behavior formulas](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-formulas-in-depth).

## Syntax

**Exit**( [*Signout*] )

- _Signout_ â€“ Optional. A Boolean value that if _true_ will sign the current user out of Power Apps. The default is _false_ and the user remains signed in.

## Examples
