# Value function in Power Apps

Converts a string of text to a number.

## Description

The **Value** function converts a string of text that contains number characters to a number value. Use this function when you need to perform calculations on numbers that were entered as text by a user.

Different languages interpret **,** and **.** differently. By default, the text is interpreted in the language of the current user. You can specify the language to use with a language tag, using the same language tags that are returned by the **[Language](function-language.md)** function.

Notes on the format of the string:

- The string may be prefixed with the currency symbol for the current language. The currency symbol is ignored. Currency symbols for other languages aren't ignored.
- The string may be include a percent sign (**%**) at the end, indicating that it's a percentage. The number will be divided by 100 before being returned. Percentages and currency symbols can't be mixed.
- The string may be in scientific notation, with 12 x 10<sup>3</sup> expressed as "12e3".

If the number isn't in a proper format, **Value** will return an error.

To convert date and time values, use the [**DateValue**](function-datevalue-timevalue.md), [**TimeValue**](function-datevalue-timevalue.md), or [**DateTimeValue**](function-datevalue-timevalue.md) functions.

## Syntax

**Value**( _String_ [, _LanguageTag_ ] )

- _String_ - Required. String to convert to a numeric value.
- _LanguageTag_ - Optional. The language tag in which to parse the string. If not specified, the language of the current user is used.

**Value**( _Untyped_ )

- _Untyped_ - Required. [**Untyped object**](../untyped-object.md) that represents a number. Acceptable values are dependent on the untyped provider.  For [**JSON**](function-parsejson.md), the untyped object is expected to be a JSON number, boolean, or text that can be converted to a number. Keep in mind that locale-related formats are important considerations when communicating with external systems.

## Examples

The user running these formulas is located in the United States and has selected English as their language. The **Language** function is returning "en-US".

| Formula                         | Description                                                                                    | Result  |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **Value( "123.456" )**          | The default language of "en-US" will be used, which uses a period as the decimal separator.    | 123.456 |
| **Value( "123.456", "es-ES" )** | "es-ES" is the language tag for Spanish in Spain. In Spain, a period is a thousands separator. | 123456  |
| **Value( "123,456" )**          | The default language of "en-US" will be used, which uses a comma as a thousands separator.     | 123456  |
| **Value( "123,456", "es-ES" )** | "es-ES" is the language tag for Spanish in Spain. In Spain, a comma is the decimal separator.  | 123.456 |
| **Value( "12.34%" )**           | The percentage sign at the end of the string indicates that this is a percentage.              | 0.1234  |
| **Value( "$ 12.34" )**          | The currency symbol for the current language is ignored.                                       | 12.34   |
| **Value( "24e3" )**             | Scientific notation for 24 x 10<sup>3</sup>.                                                   | 24000   |
