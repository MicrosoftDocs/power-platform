## Description

The **XSendAppNotification** function is used to send notifications within an app to a recipient. These notifications appear as either a toast or within the notification center for the app user. For more information, see [Send in-app notifications within model-driven apps](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/send-in-app-notifications).

In addition, an in-app notification can include zero to many actions on the notification card. To add actions to the app notification card, the following functions are used as parameters in the **XSendAppNotification** function. For more information on each action type, see [Notification actions](/power-apps/developer/model-driven-apps/clientapi/send-in-app-notifications#notification-actions).

- **XCreateUrlAction**: Adds a URL action to the notification card.
- **XCreateSidePaneActionForDashboard**: Adds a side pane action that navigates to a page with a type of `dashboard` within the side pane.  
- **XCreateSidePaneActionForEntity**: Adds a side pane action that navigates to a page with a type of `entityrecord` within the side pane. 
- **XCreateSidePaneActionForEntityList**: Adds a side pane action that navigates to a page with a type of `entitylist` within the side pane.

## Examples

### In-app notification with a title, recipient, and body

The following sends a simple in-app notification to a recipient with a title and body. It doesn't include any actions and utilizes default values for all other parameters.

```powerapps-dot
XSendAppNotification(
    "Welcome", 
    LookUp(Users, 'Primary Email'="<User's email address>"), 
    "Welcome to the world of in-app notifications!"
)
```
### In-app notification with two actions



The following example formula can be used with an automated plugin when a a new Task record is created. The formula is designed to send an in-app notification to the owner of the task record. The notification card contains two actions that the owner can take:

- A **side pane** action, opens the new task record in a side pane.
- A **Teams chat** action, initiates a Teams chat with the owner of the account record that is assigned as the **Regarding** table record for the new task. It's important to note that this assumes an account record has been selected in the task field.

```powerapps-dot
XSendAppNotification(
	"New task assigned",
	AsType(ThisRecord.Owner, Users),
	"A new task has been assigned to you to follow up with your customer",
	[XCreateSidePaneActionForEntity(
		"View task",
		1123,
		"Your task",
		"task",
		ThisRecord.Task    
		),
	XCreateTeamsChatAction(
		"Chat with account manager",
		[AsType(AsType(ThisRecord.Regarding, Accounts).Owner, Users).'Azure AD Object ID'],
		AsType(ThisRecord.Regarding, Accounts).Account, 
		"account", 
		ThisRecord.Description
		)
	]
)

```
