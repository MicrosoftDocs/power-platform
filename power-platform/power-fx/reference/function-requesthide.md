# RequestHide function in Power Apps

Hides the [SharePoint form](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/sharepoint-form-integration#understand-the-sharepointintegration-control).

> [!NOTE]
> Only works with [SharePoint forms](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/sharepoint-form-integration).

## Description

Use the **RequestHide** function to hide the SharePoint form. By default, RequestHide() is used for the _OnSuccess_ property of a SharePoint form being customized.

![RequestHide example.](media/function-requesthide/requesthide-fuction.png)

This function is not required for the **SharePointIntegration** control's **OnCancel** event as SharePoint by default hides the form when a user selects **Cancel**, and the function only reacts to a SharePoint form.

## Syntax

**RequestHide** ( )

- No parameters.

## Examples

| Formula           | Description     |
