# Error, IfError, IsError, IsBlankOrError functions

**Applies to:** :::image type="icon" source="media/yes-icon.svg" border="false"::: Canvas apps :::image type="icon" source="media/yes-icon.svg" border="false"::: Dataverse formula columns :::image type="icon" source="media/yes-icon.svg" border="false"::: Desktop flows :::image type="icon" source="media/yes-icon.svg" border="false"::: Model-driven apps :::image type="icon" source="media/yes-icon.svg" border="false"::: Power Platform CLI

Detects errors and provides an alternative value or takes action. Create a custom error or pass through an error.

> [!NOTE]
>
> - The behavior that this article describes is available only when the _Formula-level error management_ preview feature in [Settings > Upcoming features > Preview](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-experimental-preview#controlling-which-features-are-enabled) is turned on.

## IfError

The **IfError** function tests values until it finds an error. If the function discovers an error, the function evaluates and returns a corresponding replacement value and stops further evaluation. A default value can also be supplied for when no errors are found. The structure of **IfError** resembles that of the **If** function: **IfError** tests for errors, while **If** tests for **true**.

Use **IfError** to replace an error with a valid value so that downstream calculations can continue. For example, use this function if user input might result in a division by zero:

```powerapps-dot
IfError( 1/x, 0 )
```

This formula returns `0` if the value of `x` is zero, as `1/x` will produce an error. If `x` isn't zero, then `1/x` is returned.

### Stopping further processing

When [chaining](operators.md) formulas together in [behavior formulas](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-formulas-in-depth), such as:

```powerapps-dot
Patch( DS1, ... );
Patch( DS2, ... )
```

The second [**Patch**](function-patch.md) function to `DS2` will be attempted even if the **Patch** to `DS1` fails. The scope of an error is limited to each formula that is chained.

Use **IfError** to do an action and only continue processing if the action was successful. Applying **IfError** to this example:

```powerapps-dot
IfError(
    Patch( DS1, ... ), Notify( "problem in the first action" ),
    Patch( DS2, ... ), Notify( "problem in the second action" )
)
```

If the **Patch** of `DS1` has a problem, the first **Notify** is executed. No further processing occurs including the second **Patch** of `DS2`. If the first **Patch** succeeds, the second **Patch** will execute.

If supplied, the optional _DefaultResult_ argument is returned if no errors are discovered. Without this argument, the last _Value_ argument is returned.

Building on the last example, the return value from **IfError** can be checked to determine if there were any problems:

```powerapps-dot
IfError(
    Patch( DS1, ... ), Notify( "problem in the first action" );  false,
    Patch( DS2, ... ), Notify( "problem in the second action" ); false,
    true
)
```

### Type compatibility

**IfError** will return the value of one of its arguments. The types of all values that might be returned by **IfError** must be compatible.

In the last example, **Patch** will return a record that isn't compatible with the Booleans used for the _Replacement_ formulas or the _DefaultResult_. Which is fine, since there's no situation in which the return value from these **Patch** calls would be returned by **IfError**.

> [!NOTE]
> While the behavior in process for a change, the types of all arguments to **IfError** must be compatible currently.

In the simple example described earlier:

```powerapps-dot
IfError( 1/x, 0 )
```

The types of `1/x` and `0` were compatible as both were numbers. If they're not, the second argument will be coerced to match the type of the first argument.

Excel will display **#DIV/0!** when a division by zero occurs.

Consider **IfError** with the following instead:

```powerapps-dot
IfError( 1/x, "#DIV/0!" )
```

The above formula won't work. The text string `"#DIV/0!"` will be coerced to the type of the first argument to **IfError**, which is a number. The result of **IfError** will be yet another error since the text string can't be coerced. As a fix, convert the first argument to a text string so that **IfError** always returns a text string:

```powerapps-dot
IfError( Text( 1/x ), "#DIV/0!" )
```

As seen above, **IfError** can return an error if the _Replacement_ or _DefaultResult_ is an error.

### FirstError / AllErrors

Within in the replacement formulas, information about the errors found is available through the **FirstError** record and **AllErrors** table. **AllErrors** is a table of error information records with **FirstError** being a shortcut to the first record of this table. **FirstError** will always return the same value as **First( AllErrors )**.

Error records include:

| Field        | Type                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Kind**     | ErrorKind enum (number) | Category of the error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Message**  | Text string             | Message about the error, suitable to be displayed to the end user.                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Source**   | Text string             | Location in where the error originated, used for reporting. For example, for a formula bound to a control property, this will be in the form _ControlName.PropertyName_.                                                                                   |
| **Observed** | Text string             | Location in where the error is surfaced to the user, used for reporting. For example, for a formula bound to a control property, this will be in the form _ControlName.PropertyName_.                                                                      |
| **Details**  | Record                  | Details about the error. At present, details are provided only for network errors. This record includes **HttpStatusCode** whcih contains the HTTP status code and **HttpResponse** which contains the body of the response from the connector or service. |

For example, consider the following formula as a [**Button**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-button) control's **OnSelect** property:

```powerapps-dot
Set( a, 1/0 )
```

And this formula on the **OnSelect** property of a second [**Button**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-button) control:

```powerapps-dot
IfError( a, Notify( "Internal error: originated on " & FirstError.Source & ", surfaced on " & FirstError.Observed ) )
```

The example formula above would display the following banner when the two buttons are activated in sequence:

![Button control activated, showing a notification from the Notify function.](media/function-iferror/notify-firsterror.png)

Typically, there'll be only one error that **FirstError** can sufficiently work with. However, there are scenarios where multiple errors may be returned. For example, when using a [formula chaining operator](./operators.md) or the [**Concurrent** function](./function-concurrent.md). Even in these situations, reporting **FirstError** might be enough to reveal a problem instead overloading a user with multiple errors. If you still have a requirement to work with each error individually, you can use the **AllErrors** table.

## IsError

The **IsError** function tests for an error value.

The return value is a Boolean _true_ or _false_.

Using **IsError** will prevent any further processing of the error.

## IsBlankOrError

The **IsBlankOrError** function tests for either a blank value or an error value and is the equivalent of `Or( IsBlank( X ), IsError( X ) )`.

When enabling error handling for existing apps, consider replacing **IsBlank** with **IsBlankOrError** to preserve existing app behavior. Prior to the addition of error handling, a _blank_ value was used to represent both null values from databases and error values. Error handling separates these two interpretations of _blank_ which could change the behavior of existing apps that continue to use **IsBlank**.

The return value is a boolean _true_ or _false_.

Using **IsBlankOrError** will prevent any further processing of the error.

Use the **Error** function to create and report a custom error. For example, you might have logic to determine whether any given value is valid for your context or not&mdash;something not checked for a problem automatically. You can create and return your own error, complete with **Kind** and **Message**, using the same record described above for the **IfError** function.

In the context of **IfError**, use the **Error** function to rethrow or pass through an error. For example, your logic in **IfError** may decide that in some cases an error can be safely ignored, but in other cases the error is important to send through. Within **IfError** or **App.OnError**, use **Error( FirstError )** to pass through an error.

The **Error** function can also be passed a table of errors, as would be found in the **AllErrors** table. Use **Error( AllErrors )** to rethrow all the errors and not just the first.

A _blank_ record or empty table passed to **Error** results in no error.

## Syntax

- _ErrorTable_ – Required. Table of error information records. **AllErrors** can be passed directly.

**IfError**( _Value1_, _Replacement1_ [, _Value2_, _Replacement2_, ... [, *DefaultResult* ] ] )

- _Value(s)_ – Required. Formula(s) to test for an error value.
- _Replacement(s)_ – Required. The formulas to evaluate and values to return if matching _Value_ arguments returned an error.
- _DefaultResult_ – Optional. The formulas to evaluate if the formula doesn't find any errors.

**IsError**( _Value_ )<br>**IsBlankOrError**( _Value_ )

| **IfError( 1, 2 )**                                           | The first argument isn't an error. The function has no other errors to check and no default return value. The function returns the last _value_ argument evaluated.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | 1      |
| **IfError( 1/0, 2 )**                                         | The first argument returns an error value (because of division by zero). The function evaluates the second argument and returns it as the result.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | 2      |
| **IfError( 10, 20, 30 )**                                     | The first argument isn't an error. The function has no other errors to check but does have a default return value. The function returns the _DefaultResult_ argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | 30     |
| **IfError( 10, 11, 20, 21, 300 )**                            | The first argument **10** isn't an error, so the function doesn't evaluate that argument's corresponding replacement **11**. The third argument **20** isn't an error either, so the function doesn't evaluate that argument's corresponding replacement **21**. The fifth argument **300** has no corresponding replacement and is the default result. The function returns that result because the formula contains no errors. | 300    |
| **IfError( 1/0, Notify( "There was an internal problem" ) )** | The first argument returns an error value (due to division by zero). The function evaluates the second argument and displays a message to the user. The return value of **IfError** is the return value of **Notify**, coerced to the same type as the first argument to **IfError** (a number).                                                                                                                                 | 1      |

| ------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------- |
| **IsError( 1 )**                                                    | The argument isn't an error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | _false_ |

| **IsError( 1/0 )**                                                  | The argument is an error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | _true_  |
| **If( IsError( 1/0 ), Notify( "There was an internal problem" ) )** | The argument to **IsError** returns an error value (because of division by zero). This function returns _true_, which causes the **If** to display a message to the user with the **Notify** function. The return value of **If** is the return value of **Notify**, coerced to the same type as the first argument to **If** (a boolean). | _true_  |

### Simple IsBlankOrError

| Formula                       | Description                             | Result  |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------- |
| **IsBlankOrError( 1 )**       | The argument isn't an error or a blank. | _false_ |
| **IsBlankOrError( Blank() )** | The argument is a blank.                | _true_  |
| **IsBlankOrError( 1/0 )**     | The argument is an error.               | _true_  |

### Simple Error

In this example, dates are validated relative to one another, resulting in an error if there is a problem.

```powerapps-dot
If( StartDate > EndDate,
    Error( { Kind: ErrorKind.Validation, Message: "Start Date must be before End Date" } ) )
```

In this example, some errors are allowed to pass through while others are supressed and replaced with a value. In the first case, **b** will be in an error state because the **Value** function has an invalid argument. Because this is unexpcted by the formula writer, it is passed through so the user will see it. In the second case, with the same formula, **b** will have the value 0, resulting in a division by zero. In this case, the formula writer may know that this is acceptable for this logic, suppress the error (no banner is shown), and return -1 instead.

```powerapps-dot
With( {a: 1, b: Value("a")},
      IfError( a/b, If( FirstError.Kind <> ErrorKind.Div0, Error( FirstError ), -1 ) ) )
// returns an error with Kind = ErrorKind.InvalidArgument

With( {a: 1, b: 0} )
      IfError( a/b, If( FirstError.Kind <> ErrorKind.Div0, Error( FirstError ), -1 ) ) )
// returns -1
```

The **AllErrors** table can be filtered like any other table. Used with the **Error** function, expected errors can be removed and the remaining errors retained and reported. For example, if we knew that division by zero was not going to be a problem in a particular context, those errors could be filtered out, leaving all other errors intact with the following formula:

```powerapps-dot
Error( Filter( AllErrors, Kind <> ErrorKind.Div0 ) )
```

### Step by step

1. Add a **[Text input](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-text-input)** control, and name it **TextInput1** if it doesn't have that name by default.

1. Add a **[Label](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/control-text-box)** control, and name it **Label1** if it doesn't have that name by default.

1. Set the formula for **Label1**'s **Text** property to:

   ```powerapps-dot
   IfError( Value( TextInput1.Text ), -1 )
   ```

1. In **TextInput1**, enter **1234**.

   Label1 will show the value **1234** as this is a valid input to the Value function.
