# Count, CountA, CountIf, and CountRows functions

**Applies to:** :::image type="icon" source="media/yes-icon.svg" border="false"::: Canvas apps :::image type="icon" source="media/yes-icon.svg" border="false"::: Desktop flows :::image type="icon" source="media/yes-icon.svg" border="false"::: Model-driven apps :::image type="icon" source="media/yes-icon.svg" border="false"::: Power Platform CLI

Counts all [records](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-tables#records) in a [table](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-tables), or counts all records that satisfy a condition.

## Description

The **Count** function counts the number of records that contain a number in a single-column table.

The **CountA** function counts the number of records that aren't _blank_ in a single-column table. This function includes [empty](function-isblank-isempty.md) text ("") in the count.

The **CountIf** function counts the number of records in a table that are **true** for a logical formula. The formula can reference [columns](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-tables#columns) of the table.

The **CountRows** function counts the number of records in a table.

Each of these functions returns a number.

You need to enable the **Enhanced delegation for Microsoft Dataverse** option in the advance settings to make **CountIf** and **CountRows** functions delegation to work. To enable the option:

1. Open the app where you want to use the functions.
1. Select **Settings** > **Upcoming features** > **Preview**.
1. Turn on the **Enhanced delegation for Microsoft Dataverse** option.

<!--[!INCLUDE [delegation-no](../../includes/delegation-no.md)]-->

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - There is a 50K delegation limit if you use `CountRows` and `CountIf` functions with filters. There is no hard limit on the `CountRows` function when extracted directly from the data source because of the cached count that Dataverse keeps.
> - If the `CountRows(<Data Source>)` function is used without filtering, the count might not be 100% accurate, because the cached count updates periodically. If you need precise count and expect the result to be under the aggregate limit, you can bypass the cached count via `CountIf(<Data Source>, True)`.

## Syntax

**Count**( _SingleColumnTable_ )<br>
**CountA**( _SingleColumnTable_ )

- _SingleColumnTable_ - Required. Column of records to count.

**CountIf**( _Table_, _LogicalFormula_ )

- _Table_ - Required. Table of records to count.
- _LogicalFormula_ - Required. Formula to evaluate for each record of the table. Records that return **true** for this formula are counted. The formula can reference columns of the table.

**CountRows**( _Table_ )

- _Table_ - Required. Table of records to count.

## Example

1. Import or create a [collection](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-data-sources#collections) named **Inventory**, as the first subprocedure in [Show images and text in a gallery](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/show-images-text-gallery-sort-filter) describes.
2. Add a label, and set its **[Text](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/properties-core)** property to this formula:

   **CountIf(Inventory, UnitsInStock < 30)**

   The label shows **2** because two products (Ganymede and Callisto) have fewer than 30 units in stock.

3. Add another label, and set its **[Text](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/properties-core)** property to this formula:

   **CountA(Inventory.UnitsInStock)**

   The label shows **5**, the number of non-empty cells in the **UnitsInStock** column.

4. Add another label, and set its **[Text](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/controls/properties-core)** property to this formula:

   **CountRows(Inventory)**

   The label shows **5** because the collection contains five rows.
