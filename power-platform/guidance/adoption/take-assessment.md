The Power Platform adoption assessment is a comprehensive evaluation of an organization's current use of Microsoft Power Platform. This assessment identifies opportunities to optimize and streamline efforts, share best practices, and provide recommendations for how an organization can better use Power Platform to achieve its business objectives.
