# Share templates and reusable components

Recreating branding, layouts, links, complex connectors, and flows from scratch is tedious and error-prone. This article explains how to leverage the catalog in Power Platform to streamline development, foster collaboration among fusion teams, and ensure consistent use of components. 

Use the [catalog in Power Platform](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/catalog-overview) to:

- Crowd-source and find templates and components within the organization easily
- Find and install the latest authoritative version of a component
- Start using templates and components that provide immediate value

- [Set up the catalog](/power-platform/admin/administer-catalog#set-up-the-catalog)

## Additional guidelines

You might have additional guidelines, such as brand standards, logos, brand pictures, colors, and accessibility standards in the form of PDFs or links on your intranet. Make sure your makers know how to find these guidelines and make them easily available to your [maker community](wiki-community.md).
