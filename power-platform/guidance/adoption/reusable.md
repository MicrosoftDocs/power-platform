# Power Platform- Share reusable components and templates

Recreating branding, layouts, links, complex connectors, and flows from scratch every time is tedious and prone to errors. Organizations where developers and makers build and share customized and reusable components and templates get more value from Power Platform. Successful organizations use a fusion teams model where pro-developers, makers, and admins work together to deliver the best solutions for their users. This approach helps them gain the highest value from Power Platform.

Use the [catalog in Power Platform](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/catalog-overview) to

- Crowd-source and find templates and components within their organization easily
- Find and install the latest and authoritative version of a component
- Get started with templates and components that provide immediate value

## Additional guidelines

You might have additional guidelines, such as brand standards, logos and brand pictures, colors, accessibility standards in the form of PDFs, or links on your intranet. Make sure your makers know how to find  guidelines, and make them easily available in to your [maker community](wiki-community.md).
