# Define community core team roles and responsibilities

When defining the core team roles and responsibilities for your community, consider the community's size, scope, and objectives. 

## Primary roles and responsibilities

Consider the following areas of responsibility:

- **Community lead**: The community lead oversees the overall management of the community. This includes monitoring community activities, reporting on progress, and ensuring that the community's goals are being met. They are the primary point of contact for the community and provide strategic direction.
- **Content lead**: The content lead is responsible for developing and curating content for the community. This includes creating news updates, training resources, and collateral for new programs. They ensure that the content is relevant, engaging, and aligns with the community's objectives.
- **Event lead**: The event lead organizes and manages community events. This includes planning and running activities such as solution showcases, 'Ask an expert' sessions, and hackathons. They ensure that events run smoothly and provide valuable experiences for community members.
- **Community advocate(s)**: Community advocates act as liaisons between the community and the core team. They represent the interests and feedback of community members, ensuring that their voices are heard. Advocates help to foster a sense of belonging and engagement within the community.

Depending on your organization's size and team structure, these roles may not be dedicated positions. Instead, team members might take on multiple responsibilities, fulfilling the objectives of each role. Or a single team member might oversee all areas, including community management, content creation, event organization, and member liaison.
