# Develop a vision for adopting Microsoft Power Platform

"Why are we adopting Microsoft Power Platform?" This is a common question for both businesses and technical stakeholders. If the answer is, "Our board (or CIO or C-level executives) told us to use low code," it might be more difficult for those businesses to achieve their expected outcomes. Similarly, organization that start their adoption journey with a viewpoint that’s focused on governance and control often take longer to reach success than those that start their journey with commitment and a shared purpose for why low code is important to the organization. 

This article discusses will help you craft an emergent vision, focus areas and key success measures for Power Platform adoption in your organization.​ Understanding the vision and objectives will help you achieve positive business outcomes and alignment with your organizational strategy. 

## Motivation

Various motivations can drive business transformations that are supported by cloud adoption. Several motivations likely apply at the same time. The goal of the list in the following table is to help generate ideas about which motivations are relevant. From there, you can evaluate and assess the potential impacts of the applicable motivations. Your cloud adoption team should meet with the stakeholders, executives, and business leaders and discuss which motivations can help your business's cloud adoption.

## Model (Strategy on a page?)

To define a Power Platform adoption vision, we use a structured model that involves crafting an emergent vision, defining focus areas and key success measures for Power Platform in your organization.​​

### Identify key results

Begin by identifying potential success measures for Power Platform, using the collective insights of stakeholders within your organisation. It is important to evaluate these success measures to ensure they align with the organisational vision and supporting strategies. Reflect on the question: If Power Platform were to be successful, what tangible benefits would we observe compared to the current state?

Key Results are specific, measurable outcomes that indicate progress towards achieving the strategic objectives. Key results help in tracking performance and ensuring that the objectives are being met. They provide clear benchmarks for success and are often quantifiable, such as reducing operational costs by 15%, increasing employees that use Power Platform by 20%, or reducing cost and potential errors through using automation.

Imagine Power Platform is executed brilliantly and becomes a huge success. How might things be different from now? Consider the indicators of success: how will you know you have succeeded? What changes, including behaviours, would signify success? For instance, you might observe reduced third-party product spend, increased business areas building their own solutions, and a reduced IT development backlog. Reflect on the potential shifts in behaviour within your team, division, and organisation. For example, business departments might start seeing IT as enablers and consult IT in their decisions on tools to use, or might use Power Platform to solve their own problems. Identify the current challenges or issues and explore the opportunities that may arise from addressing them. These insights will inform your success measures.

#### Aligning to organization direction

TODO

### Disocver objectives

Proceed to discover the top themes that will drive this success. This involves a thorough discussion of the important aspects that must be addressed to ensure the desired outcomes. Understanding the underlying reasons for these themes will provide a solid foundation to ensure success.​

Objectives are the key themes or focus areas that the strategy aims to achieve. They are broad, overarching goals that align with the organisational vision and priorities. Objectives provide direction and set the stage for the initiatives and key results. For example, an objective might be to enhance employee engagement or improve operational efficiency

Once the objectives are defined, the next step is to create a detailed roadmap that outlines the necessary steps to achieve these objectives. This roadmap should include setting milestones, timelines, and assigning responsibilities for each initiative. It is important to ensure that the roadmap remains flexible to accommodate changes and adjustments based on feedback and evolving business needs. By following this structured approach, we can effectively align our Power Platform strategy with the organisational direction and ensure successful implementation.


### Define initiatives

Next, outline the initiatives that need to be implemented to achieve the identified success measures. This includes detailing the actions required in the immediate term, and those planned for the next year and the following three years. A clear roadmap will help facilitate the execution these initiatives.

Initiatives are the specific actions or projects that need to be implemented to achieve the objectives. They outline what needs to be done in the immediate term, as well as in the next year and three years. Initiatives are actionable steps that drive progress towards the key results and objectives. Examples of initiatives might include launching a new customer loyalty programme or implementing a new IT system

### Craft a vision statement

The vision statement is an aspirational declaration that encapsulates the desired future state of the organisation. It serves as a guiding beacon, providing a clear direction for the strategy. The vision statement should be inspiring and actionable, reflecting the organisation's goals and aspirations. For instance, a vision statement might be "Transform our business by fostering collaboration and leveraging digital tools to enhance efficiency and customer engagement."

The vision statement should be a statement that isn’t true today but is something you want to achieve over the next 1 – 2 years, articulating the organisation’s aspirations, values and the impact it wants to make.​ Most vision statements provide direction and purpose to the organisation on Power Platform.​

Providing guidance on creating a vision statement using common components such as goals, reasons, and methods can help customers articulate their aspirations and the impact they want to achieve with the Power Platform

1. **Step 1: Define the Goal**
    - Identify the primary objective you want to achieve. This should be a clear and concise statement that reflects the core aim of your vision.
    - Examples of common goals:
        - Empowerment and Innovation
        - Digital Transformation
        - Continuous Improvement
        - Automation and Efficiency
        - Increased Productivity and Accelerated Value
1. **Step 2: Explain the Why**
    - Articulate the reason behind your goal. This should explain the purpose or the benefit of achieving the goal.
    - Examples of common reasons:
        - To drive business value
        - To enhance productivity
        - To foster a culture of innovation
        - To improve processes
        - To achieve strategic goals
1. **Step 3: Describe the Method**
    - Outline the approach or method you will use to achieve the goal. This should be a practical and actionable statement that describes how you will accomplish the goal.
    - Examples of common methods:
        - Using secure, low-code solutions
        - Leveraging AI and automation
        - Providing tools and support
        - Implementing robust governance
        - Ensuring data cleanliness and security
        - Using data-driven decision-making
