# Develop a vision for adopting Microsoft Power Platform

"Why are we adopting Microsoft Power Platform?" is a common question for both businesses and technical stakeholders. If the answer is, "Our board (or C-level executives) told us to use low code," it might be more difficult for those businesses to achieve their expected outcomes. Similarly, organizations that start their adoption journey with a viewpoint focused on governance and control often take longer to reach success than organizations that start their journey with commitment and a shared purpose for why low code is important to the organization.

Digital transformation is largely nontechnical, focusing on cultural, organizational, and process changes. This guidance covers important aspects in crafting a vision to ensure a successful transformation. Defining a vision and having clear objectives helps you achieve positive business outcomes and alignment with your organizational strategy.

## A structured framework for creating your Power Platform Adoption vision

Adopting Power Platform can transform businesses in many ways. A vision statement gives clear direction, aligns efforts, and motivates stakeholders. Creating a vision for low-code and AI adoption is a collaborative effort that involves input from various team members over several days to ensure it resonates with the entire organization.

When crafting a vision statement for low-code and AI adoption, involve a diverse group of stakeholders to ensure the vision is comprehensive and transformative. Key stakeholders should include not only IT professionals but also representatives from broader business teams. Engaging these broader business teams early in the process helps shape a vision that aligns with the organization's overall strategic goals, rather than being solely influenced by IT administrators' goals and constraints. This inclusive approach ensures that the vision statement reflects a holistic perspective, driving transformation across the entire organization. Typical stakeholders to involve when crafting your vision statements are Power Platform admins, cybersecurity teams, data and information governance teams, business analysts, department heads, end-users, and executive sponsors, whose collective input will foster a shared commitment to the vision and its successful implementation.

Effective vision statements are composed of three key aspects: goals, reasons, and methods. By sharing common vision statements, you can generate ideas and tailor a vision that aligns with your organization's unique objectives and aspirations. This structured approach ensures that your vision isn't only inspiring but also actionable, guiding your team towards successful digital transformation.

From this table, you can mix and match the components to create cohesive and comprehensive vision statements that align with multiple goals, reasons, and methods. Your Power Platform adoption team should meet with the stakeholders, executives, and business leaders and discuss which motivations can help your business's cloud adoption.

| Common Goals | Common Reasons | Common Methods |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Empowerment and Innovation: Empower employees to innovate and create impactful solutions.  | Drive Business Value: To enhance the overall value and impact of the business. | Using Secure, Low-Code Solutions: Implementing easy-to-use, secure technology. 
| Digital Transformation: Transform business operations through the adoption of digital tools and processes. | Enhance Productivity: To improve efficiency and output. | Using AI and Automation: Utilizing artificial intelligence and automation tools. |
| Continuous Improvement: Foster a culture of ongoing improvement and learning.  | Foster a Culture of Innovation: To encourage creativity and new ideas. | Providing Tools and Support: Offering the necessary resources and assistance. |
| Automation and Efficiency: Streamline processes and increase operational efficiency. | Improve Processes: To optimize and refine business operations. | Implementing Robust Governance: Establishing strong governance practices. |
| Increased Productivity and Accelerated Value: Enhance productivity and deliver value rapidly. | Achieve Strategic Goals: To meet long-term organizational objectives. | Ensuring Data Cleanliness and Security: Maintaining high standards for data quality and protection. |

Creating a vision for low-code adoption involves a structured framework that ensures alignment with organizational goals and drives successful implementation. The framework begins with crafting a clear and inspiring vision that encapsulates the desired future state of low-code adoption within the organization. This vision serves as a guiding beacon, providing direction and motivation for the team. Next, the focus shifts to defining specific objectives that align with the vision. These objectives represent the key themes and focus areas that need to be achieved to realize the vision. Once the objectives are established, measurable key results are identified to track progress and ensure that the objectives are met. These key results provide clear benchmarks for success and help in monitoring performance. Finally, initiatives are outlined to deliver the key results and objectives. These initiatives are actionable steps and projects that drive progress towards the vision, ensuring that the low-code adoption strategy is both comprehensive and actionable. By following this framework, organizations can effectively align their low-code adoption efforts with their strategic goals, fostering innovation and driving business value.

## Craft a vision statement

The vision statement is an aspirational declaration that encapsulates the desired future state of the organization. It serves as a guiding beacon, providing a clear direction for the strategy. The vision statement should be inspiring and actionable, reflecting the organization's goals and aspirations.

The vision statement should describe something you want to achieve over the next 1-2 years. It should articulate the organizationâ€™s aspirations, values, and the impact it wants to make. Most vision statements provide direction and purpose to the organization on Power Platform.

Here are some key steps to guide you through the process of defining a meaningful vision statement.

1. **Understand the purpose**: A vision statement should articulate the long-term aspirations of your organization. It should be inspiring and provide a clear picture of what success looks like in the future.
1. **Identify key components**: A well-crafted vision statement typically includes the following components:
    - **Goal**:
        - What you aim to achieve.
        - Examples of common goals:
            - Empowerment and Innovation
            - Digital Transformation
            - Continuous Improvement
            - Automation and Efficiency
1. **Engage stakeholders**: Involve key stakeholders in the process to ensure that the vision resonates with everyone in the organization. This collaborative approach helps gain buy-in and align the vision with the organizational values and goals.
    - **Reason**:
        - The reason behind your goal.
        - Examples of common reasons:
            - To drive business value
            - To enhance productivity
            - To foster a culture of innovation
            - To improve processes
            - To achieve strategic goals
    - **Method**:
        - How you plan to achieve it.
        - Examples of common methods:
            - Using secure, low-code solutions
            - Using AI and automation
            - Providing tools and support
            - Implementing robust governance
            - Ensuring data cleanliness and security
            - Using data-driven decision-making
1. **Engage stakeholders**: Involve key stakeholders in the process to ensure that the vision resonates with everyone in the organization. This collaborative approach helps in gaining buy-in and aligning the vision with the organizational values and goals.
1. **Be clear and concise**: The vision statement should be easy to understand and remember. Avoid jargon and keep it concise while ensuring it captures the essence of your aspirations.
1. **Make it inspirational**: The vision statement should inspire and motivate employees. It should reflect the organization's commitment to excellence and continuous improvement.
1. **Reflect organizational values**: Ensure that the vision statement aligns with the core values of your organization. It should reflect what the organization stands for and its commitment to its stakeholders.
1. **Test and refine**: Once you draft the vision statement, test it with a small group of stakeholders to gather feedback. Refine it based on the feedback to ensure it resonates well and accurately reflects the organization's aspirations.

For instance, a vision statement might be - *Transform our business by fostering collaboration and leveraging digital tools to enhance efficiency and customer engagement.* This statement clearly outlines the goal, the reason behind it, and the method to achieve it.

## Identify key results

Begin by identifying potential success measures for Power Platform adoption, using the collective insights of stakeholders within your organization. It's important to evaluate the success measures to ensure they align with the organizational vision and supporting strategies. Reflect on the question: If Power Platform is successful, what tangible benefits would you observe compared to the current state?

Key results are specific, measurable outcomes that indicate progress towards achieving the strategic objectives. Key results help in tracking performance and ensuring that the objectives are being met. They provide clear benchmarks for success and are often quantifiable. For example, a key result could be reducing operational costs by 15% or increasing employees that use Power Platform by 20%.

Imagine Power Platform is executed brilliantly and becomes a huge success. How might things be different from now? Consider the indicators of success: how will you know you succeeded? What changes, including behaviors, would signify success? For instance, you might observe reduced third-party license spend, increased business areas building their own solutions, and a reduced IT development backlog. Reflect on the potential shifts in behavior within your team, division, and organization. For example, business departments might start seeing IT as enablers and consult IT in their decisions on tools to use, or might use Power Platform to solve their own problems. Identify the current challenges or issues and explore the opportunities that might arise from addressing them. These insights inform your success measures.

Here are some examples of measurable key results:

- Cultivate a low-code first mindset among employees, with ___% of employees trained and skilled in low-code development.
- Enable citizen developers through a standard onboarding process and training, increasing IT capacity by ___% and decreasing time to value by ___%.
- Achieve ___% increase in automated processes year over year.

### Aligning to organization direction

Aligning Power Platform adoption with the organizational direction involves a strategic approach to ensure that the platform's capabilities are fully used to support the company's overall goals and objectives.

It's important to understand your organization's vision, mission, and strategic goals. Engage with key stakeholders, including executives and department heads, to gather insights into the long-term objectives and priorities of the organization. By doing so, you can ensure that the Power Platform strategy aligns with the broader organizational direction.

## Discover objectives

Discover the top themes that drive this success. Discuss the important aspects that must be addressed to ensure the desired outcomes. Understanding the underlying reasons for these themes provides a solid foundation to ensure success.

Objectives are the key themes or focus areas that the strategy aims to achieve. They're broad, overarching goals that align with the organizational vision and priorities. Objectives provide direction and set the stage for the initiatives and key results. For example, an objective might be to enhance employee engagement or improve operational efficiency.

Once the objectives are defined, create a detailed roadmap that outlines the necessary steps to achieve these objectives. This roadmap should include setting milestones, timelines, and assigning responsibilities for each initiative. Ensure that the roadmap remains flexible to accommodate changes and adjustments based on feedback and evolving business needs.

Here are some examples of objectives:

- Develop a comprehensive data governance framework that ensures data quality, security, and compliance with relevant regulations.
- Establish an inclusive culture of innovation and experimentation.
- Create a culture of collaboration that drives employee satisfaction and tangible outcomes.

## Define initiatives

Next, outline the initiatives that need to be implemented to achieve the identified success measures. Initiatives are the specific actions or projects that need to be implemented to achieve the objectives. They outline what needs to be done in the immediate term, and in the next year and three years. Initiatives are actionable steps that drive progress towards the key results and objectives. Examples of initiatives might include launching a new customer loyalty program or implementing a new IT system.

Here are some examples of initiatives:

- Develop and publish a catalog of reusable app templates and components to help makers build with a reliable, reusable toolkit.
- Identify champion candidates and create incentives for makers, champions, and departments to participate in your internal Power Platform Champions program.
- Create a Maker Portal with onboarding collateral, development guidelines, self-guided learning, and success stories.
