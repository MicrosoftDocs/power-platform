# Manage resistance and avoid organizational anti-patterns

Achieving success in significant changes to business practices, culture, or technology operations necessitates a growth mindset. Central to this mindset is the ability to embrace change and offer leadership even amidst uncertainty.

## Understanding resistance to change

Resistance to change is a common challenge when introducing new technologies. Employees may fear the unknown, feel overwhelmed by new processes, or worry about their job security. Addressing these concerns is crucial for successful adoption. Anticipating resistance allows you to be proactive in identifying and managing resistance.​ Don’t be surprised, be prepared.​ Start thinking of resistance not as something to overcome, but as something to uncover.

### Strategies to manage resistance

- **Empathy – listen and understand objections**: Empathy involves actively listening to the concerns and objections of those resisting change. By understanding their perspectives and acknowledging their feelings, you can build trust and address their concerns more effectively. This approach helps in identifying the root causes of resistance and finding mutually acceptable solutions.
- **Focus on the ‘What’, Let Go of the ‘How’**: When implementing change, it’s important to clearly communicate the desired outcomes (the ‘what’) and be flexible about the methods to achieve them (the ‘how’). This allows individuals to have a sense of ownership and creativity in finding the best ways to meet the objectives, reducing resistance by involving them in the process.
- **Remove barriers**: Identify and eliminate obstacles that may hinder the adoption of change. These barriers could be structural, procedural, or psychological. By removing these impediments, you make it easier for individuals to embrace the change and reduce their resistance.
- **Provide simple, clear choices and consequences**: Offer straightforward options and clearly outline the consequences of each choice. This transparency helps individuals understand the impact of their decisions and encourages them to make informed choices that align with the desired change.
- **Show benefits in a real and tangible way**: Demonstrate the advantages of the change in a concrete and relatable manner. Use real-life examples, case studies, or pilot projects to illustrate the positive outcomes. When people see the tangible benefits, they are more likely to support the change.
- **Make a personal appeal**: Connect with individuals on a personal level by appealing to their values, aspirations, and emotions. Personal appeals can be powerful motivators, as they make the change feel more relevant and meaningful to the individuals involved.
- **Convert the strongest dissenters**: Identify the most vocal opponents of the change and work to convert them into supporters. By addressing their concerns and involving them in the change process, you can turn them into advocates who can influence others and reduce overall resistance.
- **Find a motivator**: Discover what motivates the individuals or groups resisting the change and leverage these motivators to encourage acceptance. Whether it’s career advancement, personal growth, or financial incentives, aligning the change with their motivations can help overcome resistance.

## Avoid IT fiefdoms and IT silos

Some antipatterns block the growth mindset in organizations that want to grow and transform. These antipatterns include micromanagement, biased thinking, and exclusionary practices. Many of these blockers are personal challenges that create personal growth opportunities for everyone. But two common antipatterns in IT, silos and fiefdoms, require more than individual growth or maturity to address.
