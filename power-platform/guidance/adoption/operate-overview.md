# Power Platform operations overview and strategy

Microsoft Power Platform is transforming how organizations deliver modern AI-powered customer experiences, improved employee satisfaction, and business results. Customers increasingly rely on Power Platform to run global-scale, mission critical workloads, where the risk and business impact of failure are high. These workloads demand operational excellence: highly controlled change management to avoid disruptions to stability and quality, deep insights into operations to detect and resolve issues, and resilience to recover from failures.

To address these needs, Power Platform has a suite of capabilities to empower organizations of all sizes to build, deploy, and operate their most critical workloads. These capabilities, built with both existing and emerging AI-driven solutions in mind, ensure stability and minimize disruption while maximizing the productivity of operations teams.

> For workload specific recommendations, review the [Operational Excellence checklist](/power-platform/well-architected/operational-excellence/checklist) in the [Power Platform Well-Architected](/power-platform/well-architected/) guidance. The Operational Excellence pillar defines processes for development practices, monitoring, and release management. The goal is to establish standards that reduce development time, human error, and user disruption.
