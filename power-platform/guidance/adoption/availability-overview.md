# Power Platform availability - Overview and strategy

Microsoft Power Platform is transforming how organizations deliver modern AI-powered customer experiences, improved employee satisfaction, and business results. Customers increasingly rely on Power Platform to run global-scale, mission critical workloads, where the risk and business impact of failure are high. These workloads demand operational excellence: highly controlled change management to avoid unexpected disruptions to stability and quality, deep insights into ongoing operations to detect and resolve issues, and resiliency to recover from failures.

To address these needs, Power Platform has a suite of capabilities to empower organizations of all sizes to build, deploy, and operate their most critical workloads. Built with both existing and emerging AI-driven solutions in mind, these capabilities ensure stability and minimize disruption while maximizing the productivity of operations teams.

This series of articles provides comprehensive guidance on achieving operational excellence with Power Platform. It covers key areas such as application lifecycle management, observability strategies, and data resilience.

1. [Identify mission critical workloads](identify-mission-critical.md). Discover best practices for managing the entire lifecycle of Power Platform applications, from development to deployment and maintenance.
1. [Build a disaster recovery plan](plan-disaster-recovery.md.md). Explore strategies for monitoring and optimizing the performance and health of Power Platform applications.

> [!TIP]
> For workload specific recommendations review the [Reliablity checklist](/power-platform/well-architected/reliability/checklist) of the [Power Platform Well-Architected](/power-platform/well-architected/) guidance. The Operational Excellence pillar defines processes to make your workload resilient to malfunction and to ensure that it returns to a fully functioning state after a failure occurs.
