# Power Platform availability overview and strategy

In a world where every second of downtime means lost revenue, disrupted operations, and frustrated users, high availability isn’t optional—it’s mission-critical. In an era where AI-driven agents power mission-critical workflows, ensuring always-on availability is essential for business continuity.

This series of articles provides comprehensive guidance on achieving enterprise grade availability for mission critical workloads with Power Platform. 

1. [Identify mission critical workloads](plan-mission-critical.md). Determine which workloads are essential for your business operations and require high reliability and availability.
1. [Build a disaster recovery plan](plan-disaster-recovery.md). Develop a comprehensive strategy to ensure your mission-critical workloads can recover quickly and effectively from unexpected failures or disasters.

> [!TIP]
> For workload specific recommendations review the [Reliability checklist](../../well-architected/reliability/checklist.md) of the [Power Platform Well-Architected](../../well-architected/index.yml) guidance. The Operational Excellence pillar defines processes to make your workload resilient to malfunction and to ensure that it returns to a fully functioning state after a failure occurs.
