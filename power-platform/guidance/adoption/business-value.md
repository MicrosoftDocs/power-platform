# Measuring the business value of Power Platform solutions

Measuring business value in Power Platform is an important aspect of ensuring success and return on investment. Power Platform provides a low-code/no-code platform for building applications, automating tasks, streamlining business processes, and infusing AI into your solutions. These capabilities can bring significant benefits and it's important to track and measure the value to the business that the platform is delivering.

## Why measure value?

Why does value measurement matter? It’s the driving force behind your technology investments, ensuring that every initiative is purposeful, aligned with strategic goals, and informed by data.

- **Driving shared purpose**: Value measurement provides a clear purpose by answering the fundamental question, “Why are we doing this?” It gives meaning to your technology investments, ensuring that projects have defined and meaningful goals. This clarity transforms uncertainty about what success looks like into a clear objective that guides actions, prioritizes features, and keeps everyone aligned.
- **Strategic alignment**: Value measurement ensures that Power Platform initiatives are aligned with the broader strategic goals of the business. This alignment moves technology initiatives from being isolated efforts to directly supporting what the business has identified as important, ensuring that every project contributes to the overall mission.
- **Informed decision-making**: Measuring business value equips you with the necessary information to make informed decisions about technology investments. Business value is not just a metric; it’s a strategic compass that aligns with organizational goals, optimizes resource allocation, and empowers data-driven decisions. This shift moves decision-making from being based on intuition or subjective opinions to relying on concrete data regarding performance, satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness.

The business value of the platform is often seen through two lenses: IT benefits and the value of the applications that run on it. From an IT perspective, core benefits include reducing development and maintenance costs, reducing third-party license spend, and reducing technical debt.

Power Platform solutions typically help improve one or more business value drivers, such as:

- **Performance improvement**: Solutions that help businesses improve their operational efficiency and effectiveness, improve outcomes, and increase employee and customer satisfaction. We see measurable impact in key performance indicators (KPIs) such as sales growth, time-to-market, and improved customer satisfaction.
- **Direct or indirect cost savings**: Solutions that help organizations reduce their operational costs by automating manual processes, reducing errors, and improving resource utilization. They can also help organizations save money indirectly by improving the quality of products or services, such as by reducing paper, fuel, or other resources.
- **Risk mitigation**: Solutions that help organizations mitigate risks by improving data security, ensuring compliance with regulator requirements, and reducing the risk of errors, such as reducing the risk of a process outage and data breach.
- **Business transformation**: Solutions that help organizations transform their operations and business models. This might include enabling businesses to adapt to changing market conditions, introduce new products or services, or replace aging legacy systems.

### Tangible and intangible value

Understanding tangible and intangible value is important to fully appreciate the benefits of the investments. Tangible value refers to measurable outcomes such as cost savings, increased productivity, and faster time-to-market for solutions. These are often quantified through metrics and financial reports, providing clear evidence of the platform's impact. Intangible value encompasses benefits that are not easily measured but are equally important, such as improved employee satisfaction, enhanced collaboration, and a culture of innovation.

Recognizing both types of value allows organizations to make informed decisions, justify investments, and foster a holistic approach to digital transformation.

Here are some examples of tangible and intangible value:

| Tangible value | Intangible value |
| --- | --- |
| Revenue growth ($) | Risk mitigation and compliance |
| Reduced maintenance cost ($) | Fewer disruptions |
| Reduced paperwork and admin ($) | Improved employee experience |
| Resource optimization (%) | Improved data security |

Consider how you can measure and report both tangible and intangible value, and refer to the example measurements and questions to guide your assessment:

### Performance improvements and direct or indirect cost savings

Measuring the improvements Power Platform solutions have on existing processes can be achieved in several ways.

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Time and cost savings | One way to measure the improvement in operational efficiency is by calculating the time and cost savings achieved by implementing an automated process. Compare the time taken to complete a task before and after automation, as well as the associated costs such as labor, materials, and equipment.  Savings can be calculated in terms of hours saved per week or month, reduction in errors, and costs savings per task. |
| Error reduction | One way to measure improvements in efficiency is by assessing the error rate. Automated processes are designed to minimize errors. Tracking the number of errors before and after implementation can be a good indication of the improvement in performance. |
| Productivity improvements | You can measure the productivity improvements of automated processes by comparing the output achieved before and after implementation. Include the number of completed tasks or the amount of work completed in a given time period. |

#### Example questions for assessing performance improvements and cost savings

Here are examples of questions you could ask to establish time and cost savings, error reductions, and productivity improvements:

- What was the average time it took to complete this process before automation, and what is the average time it takes now that it's automated?
- What would it mean to complete a process faster with fewer errors?
- What would you do with the time freed up?
- How much money did you spend on labor costs for this process before automation, and how much have you saved since it has been automated?
- Can you provide any examples of errors or mistakes that occurred during this process before automation, and how has automation helped reduce or eliminate those errors?
- What is the current volume of work handled by the automated process compared to the previous, manual process?
- How has the automated process improved the speed at which tasks are completed?
- Are there examples of tasks that were time-consuming or difficult to complete manually that have been made easier and faster with automation?

### Mitigating risk

Measuring the impact that a new application has on mitigating risk can be measured in several ways.

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Risk reduction | You can identify the risks that the application is designed to mitigate and track the number of incidents or issues related to those risks before and after implementation. You can also calculate the financial impact of these incidents and compare the costs before and after implementation. |
| Compliance improvement | If the new application is designed to improve compliance, you can measure the impact by assessing the compliance rate before and after implementation. You could identify the regulations or standards that the application is designed to comply with and track the compliance rate over time. |
| Incident response time | You can compare the time taken to identify the source of an issue over the time taken to resolve the issue before and after implementation.|

#### Example questions for assessing risk mitigation

Here are examples of questions you could ask to establish risk reduction, compliance improvement, and incident response times:

- How has the Power Platform solution helped to reduce the likelihood of errors or mistakes occurring in the process or function it supports?
- How has the Power Platform solution helped to increase the security and compliance measures for the process or function it supports?
- Are there examples of situations where the Power Platform solution has helped to identify or mitigate risks and issues before they become significant problems?
- What was the average response time for incidents before the Power Platform solution was developed, and how does this compare to the current average response time?

### Business transformation

Many different metrics can be used to measure the impact new applications and solutions have on business transformation. The most appropriate metrics depend on the specific application or process being implemented and the goals of the business transformation initiative. Here are some common methods:

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Efficiency improvement | Assess the efficiency improvement achieved by implementing the solution by comparing the time taken to complete a task or process before and after implementation. |
| Revenue increase | One way to measure the impact of a new application or process is by analyzing the impact on revenue, before and after implementation. |
| Employee productivity | You could assess the productivity of employees before and after implementation. This could include comparing the output achieved, or tracking the time taken to complete a task. |
| Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) | For an on-premises or in-house system, you could assess the total cost of ownership. This includes all the costs associated with owning, operating, and maintaining the system over its lifetime. For example, you could include hardware and software costs, maintenance costs, energy and cooling costs, personnel, downtime, and replacement costs. These costs can then be compared to the cost of Power Platform. |
| Employee satisfaction | Surveys, interviews, focus groups, and analytics can be used to measure the impact of a new system or process. Using a combination of these methods, organizations can get a comprehensive view of employee satisfaction before and after a new system or process is implemented. |

#### Example questions for assessing business transformation

Here are examples of questions you could ask to establish efficiency improvement, increased revenue, employee productivity gains, and TCO:

- How much has the time to complete a particular task or process been reduced since implementing the Power Platform solution?
- Are you able to complete more tasks within the same amount of time since implementing the Power Platform solution?
- Has the number of errors or defects been reduced since implementing the Power Platform solution?
- Has the team been able to meet deadlines more consistently since the Power Platform solution was implemented?
- Has the team been able to take on extra tasks or responsibilities since the Power Platform solution was implemented?
- What are the ongoing maintenance costs for the on-premises system, including software updates, hardware, and technical support?

Aligning the business value of Power Platform solutions to the organization's KPIs and objectives and key results (OKRs) is important to maximize the impact these solutions have.

By aligning Power Platform solutions to KPIs and OKRs, organizations ensure that they're addressing the most critical business needs and driving the most significant impact. This can help ensure that Power Platform solutions are seen as valuable investments by senior leaders and decision makers who are often responsible for approving resource allocation. Various tools and calculators are available to help.

## How can we measure business value?

### Methods and tools

Measuring the business value of Power Platform solutions involves a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. 

Key methodologies include:

- **Stakeholder interviews**: Interviews are invaluable for qualitative insights. Engage with individuals involved in or impacted by the solution. Ask about their experiences, challenges, and perceived improvements. Consider using structured interview guides to ensure consistency and depth in responses. 
- **Surveys and feedback forms**: Surveys are excellent for quantitative data. They allow collecting structured feedback from a larger audience, including end-users and team members. Use a mix of closed and open-ended questions to capture both measurable data and detailed feedback.
- **Key performance indicators (KPIs)**: KPIs provide quantifiable data about the solution’s performance. Metrics like response times, resolution times, error rates, user adoption rates, and cost savings can be monitored. Ensure KPIs are aligned with business objectives.
- **User Analytics**: User analytics tools help understand user behavior and interaction with the solution. Track adoption rates, feature usage, and user engagement. Tools like Power BI can visualize this data for better insights.
- **Return on investment (ROI) calculators**: Calculating ROI involves comparing implementation costs against the benefits obtained. Both tangible and intangible benefits, such as efficiency gains, user satisfaction, and reduced operational costs, should be considered. Use standardized ROI calculation methods to ensure accuracy.
- **360-degree feedback**: Gather feedback from all angles – from end-users and customers to support agents and IT teams. This holistic approach ensures a comprehensive view of the solution’s impact. Use tools like Microsoft Forms or third-party survey platforms to facilitate this process.
- **Data integration and automation**: Automating data collection and integration with Power Platform tools ensures accurate and real-time data for measurement, reducing manual entry. Utilize connectors and APIs to streamline data flow between systems.
- **Periodic reviews**: Periodic reviews and assessments help track progress over time and make informed adjustments based on evolving needs. Schedule regular review meetings and use dashboards to present key metrics and insights.
- **Benchmarking**: Compare the performance of your Power Platform solutions against industry standards or similar implementations within your organization. This helps identify areas for improvement and set realistic performance targets.

### Choose the best method and tool

Choosing the best value measurement method and tool involves considering several key factors. Here are some steps to guide you:

- **Define your objectives**: Clearly outline what you aim to achieve with the measurement. This could include improving efficiency, tracking progress, or demonstrating value to stakeholders.
- **Identify key metrics**: Determine the specific metrics that will help you measure value. These could be financial metrics, performance indicators, or customer satisfaction scores.
- **Evaluate automation capabilities**: Look for tools that offer robust automation features. Automation can save significant time by reducing manual data entry and ensuring consistent data collection.
- **Assess reporting features**: Choose tools that provide comprehensive reporting capabilities. This includes customizable reports, real-time data visualization, and the ability to export data in various formats.
- **Consider integration**: Ensure the tool can integrate with your existing systems. This will streamline data flow and reduce the need for duplicate data entry. For example, consider integrating a feedback mechanism directly within the app to streamline the process for users. This approach eliminates the need for users to leave the app and navigate to an external form or system. By embedding feedback options within the app interface, you can capture real-time insights and improve user engagement.
- **Scalability**: Stakeholder interviews and 360-degree feedback are valuable but can be time-intensive for participants. To maximize their effectiveness, employ these methods purposefully for high-impact scenarios. Focus on situations where comprehensive insights are important.

### Scenario: How to measure business value

In the following scenario, you've been asked to measure the business value of digitizing an existing paper-based process. Consider factors such as cost savings, increased productivity, improved compliance, reduction of risk, and better data management.

#### The existing process

Your organization's field engineering team must perform a safety inspection of their vehicles daily before beginning their work. The inspection involves identifying any faults or damage, recording the mileage, and noting other relevant details. The team documents inspections on paper forms, which are stored in filing cabinets at each depot. The field engineering fleet consists of 1,000 vehicles. The inspection process takes 2 to 3 minutes per vehicle and poses challenges for tracking and analyzing the data collected and remaining compliant.

#### Measuring tangible value

- **Employee productivity and efficiency improvement**: Digitizing the process has the potential to streamline submitting and processing vehicle safety checks. Some effort will be required by the engineers in submitting vehicle checks; for example, they may need to follow new guidelines to ensure the requests are completed accurately. The tangible value of digitizing the process as measured by employee productivity and efficiency is low or difficult to calculate at this point.

- **Cost savings**: Based on the hourly rate of $50 for a field engineer, and assuming each engineer spends 12 hours per year on the process, the total cost to the organization is $600 per engineer, per year.

    Based on an analysis of time saving, the potential cost saving of digitizing the process may not be as large as expected. However, there may be intangible benefits of a digitized process, such as improved data accuracy and faster access to information, that are difficult to quantify but still add value to the organization.

#### Measuring intangible value

Forms are stored in filing cabinets at each depot, which means there's no central visibility or assurance that checks are being performed in a compliant manner. Digitizing the process and establishing a central view on compliance has the following benefits:

- **Reduction of risk**: Reduces the number of unsafe vehicles in operation and increases the number of vehicle checks being carried out.
- **Reduction of cost**: Reduces vehicle maintenance by identifying issues earlier.
- **Improved employee experience**: Improves with a simplified process.
- **Improved customer experience**: Improves with less disruption.

### Business value assessment outcome

By talking to subject matter experts and looking at the current process, you've been able to establish the value of digitizing the process using many measures:

| Measure | Business value | Value type | Value level |
|---------|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Employee productivity | Digitizing the process is unlikely to reduce the amount of time field engineers spend completing paper-based forms. | Tangible | Low |
| Efficiency improvement | Digitizing the process will increase early detection of faults. | Intangible | High |
| Reduction of risk | Digitizing the process will increase the compliance of the daily safety check and lead to a reduction in unsafe vehicles. | Intangible | High |
| Reduction of cost | There may be earlier detection of vehicle faults creating a reduction in fleet maintenance costs. | Intangible | High |
| Employee experience | Simplifying the process may lead to improved employee satisfaction and engagement as employees can complete their tasks with greater ease and efficiency. | Intangible | Medium |
| Customer experience | Less disruption due to faulty vehicles. | Intangible | High |

## What about the bigger picture - introducing value plays

So far, we’ve been focused on the app/ solution level.

Taking a step back and thinking about your adoption journey – running specific initiatives is a useful way to boost adoption by demonstrating how Power Platform can generate business value quickly. But how do you measure and communicate the value of these initiatives? Value Plays are one approach that we want to share with you.

Plus at a high-level you’ll have the key Platform value measures or key results to monitor to demonstrate ROI at the Platform level. We go into a lot of detail in this in Vision, Metrics & Goals.

Each Value Play is designed to be -
Strategic - Start with the Value Plays that are best aligned with your business objectives
Repeatable - Value measurement shouldn't just be a once-off activity, so each Value Play looks at how Power Platform can enhance existing business processes & programs
Actionable - The Value Play philosophy is 'don't try to measure everything the same way and make sure you do something with the things you do measure'

They key components of a value play are:

- Source of value: where Power Platform can prove to be uniquely valuable
- The play: key activities
- objectives: what to focus on
- audience: who needs to know
- call to action: what should they do with these insights
- value proposition
  - strategic alignment: how this activates business goals
  - tangibles & intangibles: what to measure to know you're doing well
- tips for new players: key things to get right

Like all examples, these Value Plays are not intended as an exhaustive list. They create a simple, repeatable approach to start getting traction through purposeful, strategic value measures. Your Plays can get more sophisticated as your Platform grows & matures.
