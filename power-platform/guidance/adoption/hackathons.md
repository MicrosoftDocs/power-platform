# Organize hackathons to drive innovation and collaboration

A hackathon is a fun way to engage people within your organization around a digital culture of change. The key objective is to develop sample apps and cultivate ideas to drive digital transformation. Teams come together at the line of business or global scale from different roles and departments to compete and create apps that address an organizational need.

The greater the variety of skills and roles represented, the better. One or more facilitators should be involved in organizing the hackathon and defining the teams and the rules. Consider starting the day with a review and demo of Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, Microsoft Copilot Studio, AI Builder, Microsoft Power Platform, and Microsoft Dataverse.

A successful hackathon often includes team colors, prizes, food, music, laughter, and competition.

> [!TIP]
> In addition to this guidance, you find practical step-by-step guidance and templates for running a hackathon in the [Microsoft Power Platform Hackathon Workbook](https://aka.ms/powerplatformhackathonworkbook). You find this workbook and other resources on [the Microsoft Power Platform Adoption website](https://adoption.microsoft.com/powerplatform).

## Planning and logistics

Preparation is key for a successful hackathon. Be sure to consider the following:

- Securing an executive sponsor is vital to the credibility of the hackathon.
- Set the dates, and give attendees as much notice as possible.
- Pick your judges. Choose a panel from the business, IT, and executive teams.
- For an in-person event, find a venue or room with plenty of seating, whiteboards, power sockets, reliable Wi-Fi, and projectors for presenting solutions. For a virtual event, set up Teams with private channels for each participating team to collaborate with a bridge for them to dial in to.
- Source prizes as incentives for people to participate.
- Set up a registration mechanism, such as Microsoft Forms, a SharePoint site, or a custom app.
- Determine your communication strategy, such as a newsletter, intranet, or Viva Engage/Teams.

## Readiness

-	Provide training sessions for participants—the more they know before the event, the better the apps they submit. Suggest they sign up to the [Power Up program](https://powerup.microsoft.com/?referral=learn), register for a [Power Platform in a Day workshop](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/training-workshops), or complete a [Power Platform learning path](/training/powerplatform/).
-	Set up a call before the hackathon where teams and individuals can bring their ideas and questions to discuss feasibility and unblock knowledge gaps.
-	Find out what data sources teams want to connect to, make sure test data is available, and confirm that teams have the right access. Alternatively, provide sample data as an Excel spreadsheet that teams can use to mock up their solutions.
-	Build confidence, as it's key to maximizing the productivity of the hackathon.

## Finding your ideas and use cases

Ask attendees to think about the use case they want to solve before the hackathon. Asking them to provide information on a signup form is a good way to help them start thinking about what they want to achieve.

Ask the following questions:

- What is the current process like?
- What should the future process look like?
- What are the pain points of the current process?
- What data sources are required to solve your problem?

Ask senior stakeholders to vote on the submitted ideas, and during the hackathon, have teams work only on the top-voted ideas. This strategy increases senior leadership buy-in and ensure that important solutions are addressed.

If attendees are looking to connect to third-party data sources for their solutions, make sure data is available to them. This might be as simple as preparing test data in an Excel file or populating a Dataverse entity with sample data for attendees to use.

## Teams

Ask attendees to build their own teams or pick teams for them. Make sure team members know each other and communicate before the event to prepare. Set up a Microsoft Teams channel for the hackathon and private channels for each team to facilitate collaboration.

## On the day

Make the day fun by providing snacks and plenty of coffee. Design a hackathon logo and create T-shirts, stickers, or buttons to motivate attendees. Arrange for Power Platform champions to assist attendees with technical questions and for facilitators to handle logistics, such as providing supplies or resolving access issues. ("Are there more post-its?" "We need a purple marker!" "We don't have access to *xyz*." "How do I share my whiteboard with other members on the team?")

Your hackathon can last one day or more. Plan the agenda upfront and communicate it clearly to attendees so they know how much time to set aside.

Here's a sample agenda:

| Time interval |  Activity |
|----|----|
| 15 mins	| **Introduction and Welcome**<br>Start the hackathon with an executive sponsor sharing the organization's vision. This introduction helps participants understand how to build solutions that align with the organization's vision, which is a key judging criterion. |
| 30 mins	| **Microsoft Power Platform introduction**<br>Play videos from recent Microsoft conferences or highlight [customer stories](https://www.microsoft.com/power-platform/blog/power-apps/power-platform-stories) for inspiration, especially if a public case study features a customer in a similar industry. |
| 30 mins	| **Microsoft Power Platform demonstration**<br>Demo Microsoft Power Platform using [Plan designer](/power-apps/maker/plan-designer/plan-designer) to create a comprehensive solution by describing your business problem in natural language. A hands-on presentation is a great way to introduce attendees to the power of the platform. |
| 30 mins | **Rules of engagement**, how to work, questions. |
| x hours | **Hackathon**<br>This is the main portion of the day and can last 4-5 hours on Day 1 or span multiple days. |
| 30-60 mins | **Team presentations**, discussions, and judging. |

## Team presentations and judging

Prepare a template that teams can use for the presentation. The template should include team name, app benefits, technical considerations, and vision, in addition to screenshots or process diagrams.

Prepare evaluation criteria for judges to use when judging the solutions. The criteria should range from business to technical to design categories, and take into consideration the innovation level, short- and long-term vision, and completeness. Suggest awarding bonus points for live demos during the presentation.

## After the event

Don't stop at the hackathon. Create short-term and long-term plans:

-	What's the pipeline of apps that are going to be built? 
-	Will any of the apps built during the hackathon go into production, and how can your makers get support on that journey? 
-	Build enthusiasm for Microsoft Power Platform after the event by sharing stories in internal newsletters or on your intranet. Get creative—ask attendees for quotes or interview them.
