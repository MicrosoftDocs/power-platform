# Designate the Microsoft Power Platform admin role

To help you administer environments and settings, you can assign users the Microsoft Power Platform admin role to manage Microsoft Power Platform at the tenant level. There are two Microsoft Power Platform&ndash;related service admin roles you can assign to provide a high level of admin management:

- Dynamics 365 admin
- Microsoft Power Platform admin

These are service admin roles and can be assigned via the [Microsoft 365 admin center](https://admin.microsoft.com/).
