# Designate the Microsoft Power Platform admin role

Effective management and governance of Power Platform requires a dedicated administrative role to oversee operations, ensure compliance, and optimize performance. To help you manage environments and settings, assign users the [Power Platform administrator role](../../admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant.md#power-platform-administrator) to manage Microsoft Power Platform at the tenant level. 

There are two Power Platform related service admin roles you can assign to provide a high level of admin management:

- **Power Platform administrator**: This role can perform all admin functions in Power Platform, regardless of security group membership at the environment level.
- **Dynamics 365 administrator**: This role can perform most admin functions in Power Platform, but only for environments where they belong to the security group.

These roles can't manage user accounts, subscriptions, and access settings for other Microsoft 365 apps. You need to collaborate with other admins in your organization to perform those tasks. Review the [Service administrator permission matrix](../../admin/use-service-admin-role-manage-tenant.md#service-administrator-permission-matrix) for more details of each roleâ€™s privileges.

This article outlines the responsibilities, qualifications, and best practices for designating the Power Platform admin role.

## Responsibilities of the Power Platform admin

- **Governance framework**: Develop and enforce governance policies, procedures, and best practices to ensure secure and compliant use of the Power Platform.
- **Environment management**: Oversee the creation, management, and decommissioning of environments and ensure they align with organizational goals and governance standards.
- **Security and compliance**: Implement and monitor security measures, such as data encryption and access controls, to protect sensitive information and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.

- **Integration**: Facilitate the integration of Power Platform with other enterprise systems to ensure seamless operations and data flow.
