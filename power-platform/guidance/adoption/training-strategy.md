# Establish a training and upskilling strategy for makers

Establishing a training and upskilling strategy ensures your employees are proficient in using Power Platform and fosters a culture of continuous learning and adaptability. This article explores key considerations for developing an effective training strategy.

## From awareness to value: The persona-based approach to community training and content

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, organizations are always looking for ways to boost productivity and foster innovation. To achieve continuous improvement and maximize value, tailor training and content to the needs and maturity levels of the different personas using Power Platform. We've identified three key personas for Power Platform: Explorer, Innovator, and Champion. Each persona represents a distinct stage in the journey from initial awareness to creating significant value.

### Explorer: Embarking on a digital adventure

Joining a community helps you stay updated on trends and best practices.

## Sponsorship

As you start involving more people from across your organization, you need buy-in from various stakeholders.

Citizen developers come from all parts of your organization and, traditionally, aren't part of IT. Because these people have "day jobs," they need manager buy-in to set aside time to learn about Power Platform. Making digital transformation a core objective and goal of your company is an effective way to ensure makers of all parts of the organization can dedicate time to learning about Power Platform and attending internal and external training events.

An effective way to gain buy-in is to highlight the positive impact the project and community can have for different stakeholders.

Building an innovation friendly culture takes time. It's important to address people's concerns about how it might affect their part of the organization in the short term and long term.
