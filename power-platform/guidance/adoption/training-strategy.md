# Establish a training and upskilling strategy for makers

It's important to think about your upskilling strategy for makers—what is available for new, intermediate, and advanced makers to ensure they're able to learn constantly and can get powered up.

## From awareness to value: The persona-based approach to community training & content

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, organizations are always looking for ways to boost productivity and foster innovation. To achieve continuous improvement and maximize value, tailor your training and content to the specific needs and maturity levels of different personas working with Power Platform. We identified three key personas for Power Platform: Explorer, Innovator, and Champion. Each persona represents a distinct stage in the journey from initial awareness to creating significant value.

### Explorer: Embarking on a digital adventure

The **Explorer** persona is at the beginning of their journey, eager to unlock personal productivity and discover new tools. They're curious about the Power Platform and want to learn how to build apps. Key questions for **Explorers** include:

## Sponsorship

As you start involving more people from across your organization, you need to get buy-in from various stakeholders.

Citizen developers come from all parts of your organization and, traditionally, won't sit in IT. Because these people have "day jobs," they need manager buy-in to set aside time to learn about Microsoft Power Platform. Making digital transformation a core objective and goal of your company is an effective way to ensure makers of all parts of the organization are able to dedicate time to learning about Microsoft Power Platform and attending internal and external training events.

An effective way to gain buy-in is to highlight the positive impact the project and community can have for different stakeholders.

Creating an innovation-friendly culture can take time. It's important to address people's concerns about how it might affect their part of the organization, both in the short term and the long run.
