# Nurture your Power Platform community

When your organization adopts Microsoft Power Platform, it's important to nurture your community of makers to ensure they're effectively using the tools to further your organization's goals. Nurturing makers involves understanding the needs and aspirations of individuals within the organization and aligning them with business objectives to create a cohesive and productive environment.

Nurturing your community means addressing key questions such as:

- Who are our makers?
- How can we help them succeed?
- How can we recognize their efforts and successes?
- How can we grow the community?

By exploring these questions, you embark on a journey to connect the dots and create a community that is greater than the sum of its parts. This series of articles guides you through the essential steps to nurture your Power Platform community:

1. [Define community purpose and goals](community-goals.md): Establish a clear vision and objectives for your community.
1. [Define community core team responsibilities](community-core-team.md): Assign roles and responsibilities to ensure smooth operation.
1. [Promote the community and establish partnerships](community-promote.md): Increase visibility and build relationships with other communities and stakeholders.
1. [Identify and support champions](champions.md). Recognize and empower individuals who demonstrate exceptional skills and commitment to the Power Platform community. Provide them with resources and opportunities to lead and mentor others.
1. [Onboard new makers](onboard-makers.md): Create a welcoming and informative onboarding experience for new community members and Power Platform makers.
1. [Celebrate successes](show-and-tell.md): Recognize and reward the achievements of community members to foster a positive and supportive environment.

These steps help you build a thriving Power Platform community that meets individual needs and drives organizational success.
