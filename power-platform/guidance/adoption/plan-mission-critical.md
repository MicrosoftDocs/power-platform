# Plan mission critical workloads

Learn about how Power Platform supports you in building highly reliable workloads.

## What is a mission critical workload?

The term [workload](/power-platform/well-architected/workloads) describes a set of application resources, data, and supporting infrastructure that work together to deliver desired business outcomes. A workload comprises application and technology components-such as a Power Platform solution-as well as behavioral, development, and operational processes.

A **mission-critical workload** refers to a workload that is essential for the continuous operation of a business or organization. These workloads must be highly reliable, always available, and resilient to failures.

Here are some key considerations to keep in mind when designing and implementing a mission-critical workload:

1. **Reliability and availability**: The workload must be designed to handle failures and remain operational. This includes implementing redundancy and failover mechanisms to ensure continuous availability.

1. **Security**: Security for mission-critical workloads involves protecting data integrity, confidentiality, and availability, often through a zero-trust security approach.

1. **Performance**: The workload must meet performance requirements under various conditions, ensuring that it can handle peak loads without degradation.

1. **Operational Excellence**: Continuous monitoring, logging, and alerting are essential to detect and respond to issues promptly. Operational Excellence also includes regular updates and maintenance to keep the system secure and efficient.

## What are the common challenges?

Power Platform simplifies the deployment and management of solutions. However, building mission-critical workloads that are highly reliable on the platform presents several challenges:

- Creating a reliable application at scale is complex. It demands deep platform knowledge to choose the right technologies and configure them optimally for comprehensive functionality.
- In any complex distributed system, failures are inevitable. Solutions must be architected to manage failures with correlated or cascading impacts.
- Operationalizing mission-critical workloads necessitates a high level of engineering rigor and maturity throughout the entire engineering lifecycle, along with the capability to learn from failures.

- [Reliability](/power-platform/well-architected/reliability/checklist) recommendations help you evaluate the reliability, resiliency, and failure recovery strategies in your architecture design.
- [Security](/power-platform/well-architected/security/checklist) recommendations help you guard confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your data and systems. How a workload mitigates security threats will have a significant bearing on overall reliability.
- [Operational Excellence](/power-platform/well-architected/operational-excellence/checklist) recommendations help you ensure workload quality through standardized processes and team cohesion. How a workload is able to effectively respond to operational issues will have a direct impact on application availability.
- [Performance Efficiency](/power-platform/well-architected/performance-efficiency/checklist) recommendations help you recommendations design your workload so it can grow and meet your workload usage demand. Availability is more than simple uptime, but rather a consistent level of application service and performance relative to a known healthy state.
- [Experience Optimization](/power-platform/well-architected/experience-optimization/checklist) provide meaningful and effective experiences for users of your workload. How a workload informs a user about downtime is key to keeping users informed.

## Power Plaform supports mission-critical workloads

### Increased resiliency with Azure Availability Zones

Power Platform runs on Microsoft Azure and uses [Azure availability zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/reliability/availability-zones-overview). Your applications and associated resources are stored in a container called an environment, which is hosted in a region of your choice.

Environments designated for production workloads are replicated synchronously across at least two (and typically three) physically separated Azure zones within the selected region. These zones are independent datacenters with separate power, networking, and cooling, ensuring zero data loss and rapid failover (RTO < 5 min) in case of a failure.  This means that if one availability zone (AZ) experiences a failure (for example, due to a network outage, power disruption, or environmental disaster), customer traffic is automatically redirected to the other zones with minimal service disruption. Your applications and resource running will not experience an outage because Power Platform continuously ensures seamless failover and uninterrupted performance.

### Regularly back up environments

Power Platform automatically creates backups of your environments, typically on a daily basis. These backups include all the data, configurations, and customizations within the environment. In addition to automatic backups, administrators can also create manual backups at any time. Manual backups are useful before making significant changes or updates to the environment.

You can now extend their backup retention from seven to 28 days by making an environment [managed](/power-platform/admin/managed-environment-overview). Learn more in [Back up and restore environments](/power-platform/admin/backup-restore-environments).
