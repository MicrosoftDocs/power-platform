# Roles and responsibilities

Clearly defining roles and responsibilities is important for the successful adoption of Power Platform, as it ensures clarity, accountability, and efficient implementation. This approach fosters collaboration, aligns initiatives with strategic goals, and ensures compliance and security.

As part of planning your [Power Platform Center of Excellence](coe.md), it’s essential to assign well-defined roles and responsibilities to the growing group of stakeholders. As engagements evolve, the stakeholder groups expand, requiring more granular roles and actions to be tracked against responsible individuals. A well-constructed RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix brings clarity to roles and responsibilities, ensuring smoother management.

It's important to definin clear roles and responsibilities to support:

- **Accountability**: It ensures that everyone knows their specific duties, which helps in holding individuals accountable for their tasks.
- **Efficiency**: Clear roles prevent overlap and redundancy, leading to more efficient use of resources and time.
- **Collaboration**: It fosters better collaboration and communication among team members, as everyone understands their role in the bigger picture.
- **Consistency**: It helps maintain consistency in processes and practices, which is crucial for scaling and sustaining the adoption of Power Platform.
- **Governance**: Clear roles are vital for governance, ensuring that policies and procedures are followed, and that the platform is used securely and compliantly.

Task clarity refers to the clear definition and understanding of the specific tasks that need to be completed. It ensures that each team member knows exactly what is expected of them, including the steps and standards required to accomplish their tasks. This clarity helps reduce confusion, improve efficiency, and ensure that everyone is working towards the same objectives.

To identify and define tasks:

- **Break down goals**: Start by breaking down the overall goals into smaller, manageable tasks. This helps in understanding what needs to be done to achieve the larger objectives.
- **Assign responsibilities**: Clearly assign each task to a specific role or individual. Ensure that everyone knows their responsibilities and how their tasks contribute to the overall goals.
- **Detail steps and standards**: Define the steps required to complete each task and the standards that need to be met. This includes specifying deadlines, quality expectations, and any necessary resources.
- **Communicate clearly**: Ensure that all team members are aware of their tasks and have the information they need to complete them. Regular communication helps in addressing any uncertainties and keeping everyone aligned.
- **Monitor and adjust**: Continuously monitor the progress of tasks and make adjustments as needed. This helps in ensuring that tasks are being completed effectively and any issues are addressed promptly.

As you identify and define tasks, consider how your organization’s current processes can be applied to Power Platform. Key factors to consider include:

- Criteria and conditions for when an app requires cybersecurity review​
- Business / architectural / security impact assessments​
- Project sizing and delivery standards (if PMO exists)​
- Approval​
- Onboarding
- Change management​
- Handover to support

Prioritize the identified tasks into horizons:

**Horizon Mapping** is a technique used to visualize and prioritize tasks across different time horizons. By mapping tasks into immediate, near-term, and long-term horizons, organizations can ensure that they are addressing urgent needs while also planning for future objectives. This approach helps in balancing short-term demands with long-term strategic goals, ensuring sustained progress and alignment with overall business objectives.

- **Horizon 1 (immediate)**: Tasks that need to be completed in the short term, typically within days or weeks. These are urgent and critical for immediate goals.
- **Horizon 2 (near-term)**: Tasks that are important but not urgent, usually planned for the next few months. These tasks support medium-term objectives.
- **Horizon 3 (long-term)**: Tasks that are part of long-term planning, often spanning several months to years. These tasks align with strategic goals and future growth.

As you map tasks into horizons, consider dependencies between the initiatives, budget, current projects happening or planned, people movements when road mapping.

## Example RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix

After identifying the roles and tasks, organize them into a RACI matrix. The purpose of a RACI matrix is to clarify roles and responsibilities by defining who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each task. This ensures clear communication and accountability within the team.

- Start by listing all the tasks and roles involved in your project. Begin by listing all the tasks involved in your project in the left-hand column. Then, list all the roles across the top row of the matrix.
- For each task, assign the appropriate RACI value to each role.
  - Responsible (R): The person who performs the task.
  - Accountable (A): The person ultimately answerable for the task’s completion.
  - Consulted (C): People who provide input and feedback.
  - Informed (I): People who need to be kept informed of progress and outcomes.
- Ensure that each task has one Accountable person and that responsibilities are clearly distributed.
- Share the RACI matrix with the team to ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities.

Here’s a simple example to illustrate how to create a RACI matrix:

| Roles/Tasks | Power Platform product owner | Power Platform admin | Pro-Dev team | Information Security and Compliance | Enterprise Architects | Community Lead | IT support | Makers and end users |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Configure and enable cross-tenant isolation** | A | R |  | C |  |  | I |  |
