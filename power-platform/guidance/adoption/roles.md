# Roles and responsibilities

We recommend including the following roles and responsibilities when establishing a Center of Excellence. In your organization, this might be different, or you might start with only a few roles and grow to more as your adoption journey continues.

## Low-code strategy team

The low-code strategy team represents the key decision maker, and ensures the Microsoft Power Platform strategy is aligned with organizational goals. This team also is responsible for adoption and change management, and for looking at ways of working across the organization. As a driver for digital innovation, they ensure a concrete action plan for increasing digital literacy is in place. Often that is achieved through a combination of bottom-up and top-down initiatives. Bottom up: educate your makers, make it less scary, and drive self-enablement. Top down: work on executive literacy and creating an innovation-friendly culture.

## Microsoft Power Platform admin team

The Microsoft Power Platform admin team is responsible for establishing an environment strategy, setting up [data loss prevention (DLP) policies](dlp-strategy.md), and managing users, [capacity, and licensing](capacity-and-licenses.md). They also make data available to makers through connectors, integration, or migration. Check out our [Admin and governance best practices checklist](admin-best-practices.md) to learn more.

## Microsoft Power Platform nurture team

The Microsoft Power Platform nurture team—and this can consist of your champions—organizes app-in-a-day events and hackathons, provides mentorship to makers and ensures new makers get off to a good start, and really look to evangelizing the platform. Check out our [Nurture best practices checklist](nurture-best-practices.md) to learn more.

## Automation and reusable components

We recommend that you have a team or function that looks at automating tasks, such as archiving unused resources, identifying highly used resources to provide more formal support, and approving environment and license requests from end users. This team would also set up application lifecycle management using the [Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools for Azure DevOps](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/alm/devops-build-tools), support architecture reviews with makers, and  share common templates and reusable components. Having these functions in place will ensure that your organization extracts benefits more quickly, by ensuring processes are consistent and best practices copied across the organization.

## User support

You'll already have an established IT ticket support process and it's important to onboard those teams as well—create guidance and FAQs and define your support processes and resources.
