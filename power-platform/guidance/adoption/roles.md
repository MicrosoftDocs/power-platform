# Define roles and responsibilities

Defining roles and responsibilities is key to successfully adopting Power Platform because it ensures clarity, accountability, and efficiency. This approach fosters collaboration, aligns initiatives with strategic goals, and ensures compliance and security.

When planning your [Power Platform Center of Excellence](coe.md), it’s essential to assign well-defined roles and responsibilities to the growing group of stakeholders. As engagements evolve, the stakeholder groups expand, requiring more granular roles and actions to be tracked against responsible individuals. A well-constructed RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix brings clarity to roles and responsibilities, ensuring smoother management.

Define clear roles and responsibilities to support:

- **Accountability**: Ensure that everyone knows their specific duties, which helps to hold individuals accountable for their tasks.
- **Efficiency**: Clearly define roles to prevent overlap and redundancy and make efficient use of resources and time.
- **Collaboration**: Foster better collaboration and communication among team members, as everyone understands their role in the bigger picture.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistency in processes and practices, which is crucial for scaling and sustaining the adoption of Power Platform.
- **Governance**: Establish clear governance roles to ensure that policies and procedures are followed and that the platform is used securely and compliantly.
- **Empowerment**: Empower team members by providing them with a clear understanding of their roles and tasks so that they feel confident.
- **Clarity**: Provide clear roles and responsibilities to help citizen makers know whom to contact for approvals, ensuring that activities are authorized efficiently and correctly.

To adopt Power Platform successfully, balance opportunity realization with risk mitigation. This balance depends on three key tenets: goal clarity, role clarity, and task clarity. In this article, you learn how to identify the roles and responsibilities involved in Power Platform adoption, outline the tasks and initiatives they undertake, and establish a RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix to bring clarity to these roles and responsibilities.

## Goal clarity

Goal clarity helps everyone understand the objectives and purpose of their work. Clear goals provide direction and motivation, helping team members align their efforts with the organization's strategic aims.  

Imagine in a year's time that Power Platform is well adopted and governed within your organization. ​How might things be different for you and users? Would you see more streamlined processes, with makers efficiently creating and managing solutions that drive business value? Would the platform be used to its full potential, fostering innovation and collaboration across departments?

Without proper governance, significant risks may arise. Poor governance can lead to security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and noncompliance with industry regulations. It can also result in inefficient use of resources, with duplicated efforts and misaligned projects. Equally, without an enablement plan for makers, they might miss discovering the benefits of Power Platform, struggle to find appropriate resources internally, or lack awareness of its capabilities, leading to a poor return on investment. Ensuring goal clarity is a critical step in mitigating these risks and achieving successful Power Platform adoption.

**Call to action**: Conduct a workshop with key stakeholders to define and document clear goals for Power Platform adoption. Focus on aligning these goals with the organization's strategic aims, identifying potential risks, and establishing governance practices to mitigate those risks. Ensure that all participants understand the importance of goal clarity and how it drives successful adoption and governance of the platform.

## Role clarity

When adopting Power Platform, it's important to achieve role clarity and define roles within your organization. Clear roles and responsibilities ensure that everyone understands their tasks, which leads to more efficient and effective collaboration. It also helps in avoiding overlaps and gaps in responsibilities, ensuring that all aspects of the adoption process are covered.

Consider the roles responsible for performing actions, as well as the roles that need to be consulted and informed. This approach ensures that all stakeholders are engaged and that the adoption process is inclusive and comprehensive.

As adoption matures, the roles within your organization may need to adapt. Initially, one person might fulfill multiple roles, but as the organization grows and the adoption process becomes more complex, you find you need to refine and expand those roles based on team needs and feedback. Similarly, roles might vary based on the organization's size and the maturity of its roles and capabilities.

*Horizon mapping* is a technique used to visualize and prioritize tasks across different time horizons. By mapping tasks into immediate, near-term, and long-term horizons, organizations ensure they address urgent needs while planning for future objectives. This approach helps in balancing short-term demands with long-term strategic goals, ensuring sustained progress and alignment with overall business objectives.

- **Horizon 1 (immediate)**: Tasks that need to be completed in the short term, typically within days or weeks. These tasks are urgent and critical for immediate goals.
- **Horizon 2 (near-term)**: Tasks that are important but not urgent, planned for the next few months. These tasks support medium-term objectives.
- **Horizon 3 (long-term)**: Tasks that are part of long-term planning, often spanning several months to years. These tasks align with strategic goals and future growth.

As you map tasks into horizons, consider dependencies between the initiatives, budget, current and planned projects, and people movements during road mapping.

## Example RACI matrix

After identifying the roles and tasks, organize them into a RACI matrix. The purpose of a RACI matrix is to clarify roles and responsibilities by defining who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each task.

1. Start by listing all the tasks and roles involved in your project. List all the tasks in the left-hand column and all the roles across the top row of the matrix.

1. Assign the appropriate RACI value to each role:
    a. Responsible (R): The person who performs the task.
    b. Accountable (A): The person ultimately answerable for the task's completion.
    c. Consulted (C): People who provide input and feedback.
    d. Informed (I): People who need to be kept informed of progress and outcomes.

1. Ensure each task has one accountable person and that responsibilities are clearly distributed.

1. Share the RACI matrix with the team to ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities.

This example illustrates how to create a RACI matrix:  

| Roles/Tasks | Power Platform product owner | Power Platform admin | Pro-Dev team | Information Security and Compliance | Enterprise architects | Community Lead | IT support | Makers and end users |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Configure and enable cross-tenant isolation** | A | R |  | C |  |  | I |  |
| **Establish environment strategy** | A | R |  |  | C |  | I | I |
| **Monitor capacity / consumption by department or organization structure** | C | A | I | C |  |  | R |  |
