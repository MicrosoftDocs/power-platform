# Roles and responsibilities

Clearly defining roles and responsibilities is important for the successful adoption of Power Platform because it ensures clarity, accountability, and efficient implementation. This approach fosters collaboration, aligns initiatives with strategic goals, and ensures compliance and security.

As part of planning your [Power Platform Center of Excellence](coe.md), it’s essential to assign well-defined roles and responsibilities to the growing group of stakeholders. As engagements evolve, the stakeholder groups expand, requiring more granular roles and actions to be tracked against responsible individuals. A well-constructed RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix brings clarity to roles and responsibilities, ensuring smoother management.

It's important to define clear roles and responsibilities to support:

- **Accountability**: It ensures that everyone knows their specific duties, which helps in holding individuals accountable for their tasks.
- **Efficiency**: Clear roles prevent overlap and redundancy, leading to more efficient use of resources and time.
- **Collaboration**: It fosters better collaboration and communication among team members, as everyone understands their role in the bigger picture.
- **Consistency**: It helps maintain consistency in processes and practices, which is crucial for scaling and sustaining the adoption of Power Platform.
- **Governance**: Clear roles are vital for governance, ensuring that policies and procedures are followed, and that the platform is used securely and compliantly.
- **Empowerment**: When team members have a clear understanding of their roles and tasks, they feel more empowered and confident in their work.
- **Clarity**: Clear roles and responsibilities help citizen makers know whom to reach out to for approvals, ensuring that activities are authorized efficiently and correctly.

To successfully adopt Power Platform, it’s important to balance opportunity realization with risk mitigation. Achieving this balance hinges on three key tenets: goal clarity, role clarity, and task clarity. In this article, you learn how to identify the roles and responsibilities involved in Power Platform adoption, outline the tasks and initiatives they undertake, and establish a RACI matrix to bring clarity to these roles and responsibilities.

## Goal clarity

Goal clarity ensures that everyone understands the overall objectives and the purpose behind their work. Clear goals provide direction and motivation, helping team members align their efforts with the organization’s strategic aims.

Imagine in a year’s time, Power Platform is well adopted and well governed within your organization. ​How would you see things being different to now for you and users? Would you see more streamlined processes, with makers efficiently creating and managing solutions that drive business value? Would the platform be used to its full potential, fostering innovation and collaboration across departments?

However, without proper governance, there are significant risks. Poor governance can lead to security vulnerabilities, data breaches, and noncompliance with industry regulations. It can also result in inefficient use of resources, with duplicated efforts and misaligned projects. Equally, without an enablement plan for makers, they might miss out on discovering the benefits of Power Platform, struggle to find appropriate resources internally, or lack awareness of its capabilities, leading to a poor return on investment. Ensuring goal clarity is a critical step in mitigating these risks and achieving successful Power Platform adoption.

**Call to action**: Conduct a workshop with key stakeholders to define and document clear goals for Power Platform adoption. This workshop should focus on aligning these goals with the organization's strategic aims, identifying potential risks, and establishing governance practices to mitigate those risks. Ensure that all participants understand the importance of goal clarity and how it drives successful adoption and governance of the platform.

## Example RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed) matrix

After identifying the roles and tasks, organize them into a RACI matrix. The purpose of a RACI matrix is to clarify roles and responsibilities by defining who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each task.

- Start by listing all the tasks and roles involved in your project. List all the tasks in the left-hand column and all the roles across the top row of the matrix.
- Assign the appropriate RACI value to each role.
  - Responsible (R): The person who performs the task.
  - Accountable (A): The person ultimately answerable for the task’s completion.
  - Consulted (C): People who provide input and feedback.
  - Informed (I): People who need to be kept informed of progress and outcomes.
- Ensure each task has one accountable person and that responsibilities are clearly distributed.
- Share the RACI matrix with the team to ensure everyone understands their roles and responsibilities.

Here’s a simple example to illustrate how to create a RACI matrix:

| Roles/Tasks | Power Platform product owner | Power Platform admin | Pro-Dev team | Information Security and Compliance | Enterprise Architects | Community Lead | IT support | Makers and end users |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Configure and enable cross-tenant isolation** | A | R |  | C |  |  | I |  |
