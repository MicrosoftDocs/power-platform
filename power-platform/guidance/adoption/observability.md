# Gain insights into Power Platform adoption

One of the key principles of administering Microsoft Power Platform is having full visibility into how your organization is using the platform. Insights into your adoption will help you govern and secure the platform, identify patterns, and nurture your makers to accelerate adoption. Only with the right insights can you make informed decisions on how to optimize the platforms usage. As your organization's adoption of Power Platform grows, it becomes even more critical to not only have full visibility but also to gain actionable insights. These insights enable you to focus your resources on what matters most, ensuring that your Power Platform environment remains efficient, secure, and aligned with your business goals.

Why insights matter:

- **Proactive issue resolution:** With comprehensive visibility, administrators can detect and address issues before they escalate, minimizing downtime and disruptions.
- **Resource optimization:** Understanding how resources are being utilized helps in optimizing their allocation, ensuring that critical areas receive the attention they need.
- **User adoption and engagement:** Monitoring user activity and adoption rates provides valuable insights into how the platform is being used, allowing for targeted training and support initiatives.
- **Security and compliance:** Visibility into data access and usage patterns is essential for maintaining security and compliance with industry regulations.

As your Power Platform adoption grows, actionable insights become more and more important. These insights help you prioritize actions and allocate resources effectively. Some key insights that an admin might focus on include:

- **Usage trends:** Identifying which apps and features are most frequently used can guide development and support efforts.
- **Performance metrics:** Monitoring app performance and identifying bottlenecks ensures a smooth user experience.
- **Security alerts:** Keeping track of security incidents and potential vulnerabilities helps in maintaining a secure environment.
- **Governance:** Ensuring that all activities comply with established governance policies is crucial for maintaining control and accountability.
- **Capacity management:** Understanding storage and license usage helps in planning for future growth and avoiding performance issues.

This article delves into the key aspects of monitoring usage and adoption, governance and security, platform health, and capacity, providing actionable recommendations for each area.

## Monitoring usage and adoption

Understanding how users interact with the Power Platform is important for driving adoption and optimizing usage.

- Track the number of active users: Track the number of users who are actively using the platform on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Identify trends in user activity to understand peak usage times and periods of inactivity.
- Monitor usage patterns and frequency: Analyze how users and makers are interacting with the platform, including which features and tools are most frequently used. Identify any underutilized features that may require additional training or promotion.
- Identify and address any barriers to adoption: Collect feedback from users through surveys, focus groups, and direct communication. Use this feedback to identify pain points, areas for improvement, and opportunities for new features.

## Governance, security and compliance

Effective governance ensures that the Power Platform is used responsibly and aligns with organizational policies.

- Ensure adherence to organizational policies and governance frameworks. stablish clear policies for the use of the Power Platform, including data handling, user access, and acceptable use. Regularly review and update policies to reflect changes in technology and business needs.
- Monitor access controls and permissions. Define roles and permissions to ensure users have appropriate access based on their responsibilities. Implement least privilege access to minimize security risks. Regularly review high-impact accounts and remove priviliges if they are no longer needed.
- Track security incidents. Implement security monitoring tools to detect and respond to threats
- Ensure the platform complies with relevant regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and CCPA. Conduct regular audits to verify compliance and address any gaps.

## Platform and solution health

Monitoring and maintaining the health of solutionsis vital for uninterrupted service and user satisfaction.

- Check the [Service health dashboard](/power-platform/admin/check-online-service-health) to view the status of the Power Platform service, details about existing service incidents, and up to 30 daysâ€™ worth of history.
