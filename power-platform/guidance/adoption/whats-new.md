# What's new in the Microsoft Power Platform adoption guidance

We build the Microsoft Power Platform adoption guidance collaboratively with our customers, partners, and internal Microsoft Teams. We release new and updated content based on new learnings and product changes. The new releases provide an opportunity for you to validate and refine your Power Platform adoption approach along with us.
