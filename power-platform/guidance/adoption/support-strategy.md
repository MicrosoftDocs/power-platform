# User and maker support strategy

There are two types of support considerations to keep in mind: user support, which helps users of production solutions, and maker support, which helps makers developing solutions.

The following articles focus on providing:

- A support and graduation framework
- A decision matrix for the supporting process
- User support internal to your organization
- External support resources

As you define your support process, it's important to review how makers and users will learn about support options available inside the organization, how you will support your makers, how your help desk will acquire required skills, and how applications graduate through different support options.

The following articles help you get started with establishing a support strategy:

- [User support](support-strategy-solutions.md)
- [Maker support](support-strategy-makers.md)
- [Maturity levels](support-strategy-maturity.md)
