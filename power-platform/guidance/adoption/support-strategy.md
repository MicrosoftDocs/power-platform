# User and maker support strategy

There are two types of support considerations to keep in mind—user support, to support users of production solutions, and maker support, to support makers developing solutions.

The following articles will focus on providing:

- A support and graduation framework.
- A decision matrix for the supporting process.
- User support internal to your organization.
- External support resources.

As you define your support process, it’s important to both review how makers and users will get and learn about support options available inside the organization, how you will support your makers, how your help desk will acquire the skills required, and how applications graduate through different support options.

The following articles can help you understand how to get started with establishing a support strategy:
