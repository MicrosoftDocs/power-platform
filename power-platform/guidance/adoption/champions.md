# Support Microsoft Power Platform champions in your organization

Champions are essential to driving awareness, adoption, and education in your organization. Peers recognize _champions_ as the _go-to_ Power Apps, Power Automate, or Microsoft Copilot Studio experts. A champion continually builds and shares their knowledge even if it's not an official part of their job role. Power Platform champions influence and help their colleagues in many ways, including solution development, skills improvement, and troubleshooting.

1. **Driving adoption**: Champions are early adopters who can influence their peers and encourage widespread use of Power Platform. Their enthusiasm and success stories serve as powerful testimonials.
2. **Knowledge sharing**: Champions possess deep knowledge of the platform and can act as mentors, sharing best practices, tips, and insights with other community members.
3. **Innovation**: Champions often lead innovative projects and experiments, pushing the boundaries of what the Power Platform can achieve. Their creativity inspires others to think outside the box.
4. **Community building**: Champions help build a sense of community by organizing events, facilitating discussions, and connecting members. They create a supportive environment where everyone can learn and grow.
5. **Recognition and motivation**: A champions program recognizes and rewards the efforts of these individuals, boosting their morale and motivating them to continue contributing to the community.

## How champions support your organization and Power Platform community?

Champions play a vital role in evangelizing and training their teams on new ways of working with Microsoft Power Platform. They build awareness, understanding, and engagement throughout the community. Here’s how champions support the community:

- **Create enthusiasm**: Champions generate excitement and drive the adoption of improved ways of working, evangelizing the value of Microsoft Power Platform across teams.
- **Build influence**: They establish a circle of influence within their teams, helping members understand the benefits and what's in it for them.
- **Bring new ways of working to life**: Champions actively implement and demonstrate new ways of working across teams.
- **Identify challenges and solutions**: They pinpoint business challenges and propose innovative solutions using the Power Platform.
- **Provide feedback**: Champions act as a bridge between the community and the Center of Excellence (CoE) team and sponsors, offering valuable feedback on the platform's features and usability.

Champions are integral to your  Power Platform community in several ways:

- **Mentorship**: They provide guidance and support to new and existing members, helping them navigate the platform and overcome challenges.
- **Advocacy**: Champions advocate for Power Platform within the organization, promoting its benefits and encouraging adoption across different teams and departments.
- **Event organization**: They often lead the organization of hackathons, workshops, webinars, and other community events that foster collaboration and learning.
- **Content creation**: Champions contribute valuable content such as tutorials, case studies, and videos that help others learn and succeed.
- **Feedback loop**: They act as a bridge between the community and the organization, providing feedback on the platform's features and usability, which can inform future improvements.

## How to identify champions

Identifying champions involves recognizing individuals who exhibit certain qualities and behaviors:

1. **Passion and Enthusiasm**: Champions are genuinely excited about the Power Platform and actively seek opportunities to learn and experiment with it.
2. **Expertise**: They have developed a strong understanding of the platform and can demonstrate their skills through successful projects and solutions.
3. **Leadership**: Champions take initiative and lead by example. They're proactive in sharing knowledge, organizing events, and helping others.
4. **Collaboration**: They're team players who actively engage with the community, participate in discussions, and collaborate on projects.
5. **Impact**: Champions make significant positive contributions to the community or the organization.

> [!TIP]
> To add an element of fun, some organizations refer to their champions network as special agents or rangers. Microsoft has an internal community called Power Platform Ninjas.

Often, individuals aren't directly asked to become champions. Instead, they're identified by the Center of Excellence (CoE) and recognized for their ongoing activities, such as frequently answering questions in internal discussion channels or participating in lunch and learns.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Someone may be acting in the role of a champion without even knowing it, and without formal recognition. The CoE should always be on the lookout for champions. CoE members should actively monitor discussion channels to see who is helpful. They should deliberately encourage and support potential champions, and when appropriate, invite them into a champions network to make the recognition formal.

## Find your champions with the right tools

If you have Microsoft 365 in your organization, it’s likely some individuals already have discovered Power Apps through exploration and Power Apps popping up in Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, and OneDrive.  

Check the [tenant-level analytics](/power-platform/admin/tenant-level-analytics) in the [Power Platform admin center](/power-platform/admin/admin-documentation?tabs=new) or make use of the [Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit](/power-platform/guidance/coe/starter-kit) dashboard to find your makers and learn about your app usage.

The [dashboard](/power-platform/guidance/coe/power-bi-nurture#makers) in the CoE Starter Kit can give you a tenant-wide overview of makers in your environment, what connectors they're using to create apps and flows. You can see your top app and flow makers, what departments they are from, and identify trends over time.

You can see how many different connectors your makers are using and learn who is exploring different connectors. A great way to identify mature makers is looking at those who try out different connectors.

 > [!TIP]
 > Even if your organization hasn't adopted Power Platform yet, it’s likely you already have a good idea of who your champions are. They are your Excel, Access, and SharePoint whizzes; or maybe they’re the troublemakers pushing the boundaries; or the ones who are first in line when there’s something new to learn. They question, they query, they encourage. Train those people. Make them Power Platform champions and help them train others—champions aren't only passionate about what they do, but are also excited to evangelize and help their peers to learn more effective ways of working.

## Create a champions program

Considerations and key actions you can take to initiate, grow, and sustain your champions network include:

### Plan your program

- Design and align the champions community to organizational objectives and vision for Microsoft Power Platform in your organization. Attain sponsorship from key stakeholders and executives. Learn more: [Define vision, metrics, and goals for nurturing a maker and champion community](common-vision/enable-maker-community.md)
- Create a plan to support the champions network. Although some aspects of a champions network are always informally led, determine to what extent the CoE purposefully cultivates and supports champion efforts throughout individual business units.
- Decide what level of commitment and expected time investment is required of Power Platform champions. (Note that the time investment can vary wildly from person to person, and team to team.) Plan to clearly communicate expectations to people who are interested to get involved. Obtain manager approval when appropriate.
- Determine how you respond to requests to become a champion, and how the CoE seeks out champions. Decide if you openly encourage interested employees to self-identify as a champion and ask to learn more (less common). Or, whether the CoE observes efforts and extend a private invitation (more common).
- Determine how membership of the champions network is managed. It could be implemented through membership in a security group.
- Be clear about program requirements: Some champion programs require that members attend the monthly meetings, hold office hours for the group of users they support, and provide training to new users. Whatever your requirements, make sure that champions are clear on how to successfully participate in the program.

### Consider how champions communicate with you and each other

- Decide how you communicate with the champions network (for example, in a Teams channel, via Viva Engage, and/or an email distribution list).
- Determine how the champions network communicate and collaborate with each other directly (across organizational boundaries), to share updates and successes, and to connect with each other.
- Hold regular meetings: Promote enthusiasm and cohesiveness of your community by holding regular monthly meetings. These can be a combination of in person and virtual meetings, but their consistency is key to having a thriving champions community.
- Create a Champions team: Your champions should use the team you have setup for them for all program communications, feedback, and to find resources. In doing this, they become increasingly familiar with the product and its benefits. Get started with the [Adopt Office 365](/microsoftteams/general-teams-templates-in-the-admin-console) teams template. It creates relevant channels and apps for your champions program.

### Focus on the people

Find enthusiastic champions who can commit time and effort. How can you help them, how can you unblock challenges, how can you celebrate them?

- Provide materials ready to support their work (for example, access to training material and templates).
- Ensure a regular rhythm for discussions with the champions on what’s working and what’s not.
- Encourage the sharing of stories, either through show-and-tell sessions or regular newsletters. You can lean on our [best practices to share success stories](show-and-tell.md) for ideas on how to structure those stories.
- Recognize and reward the work champions are doing. Remember, they're not a support team but business representatives.

## Shape the future of your CoE with champions

- Ensure champions have the resources they need, including:
  - Direct access to CoE members.
  - Influence on environment and connector strategies being implemented (for example, requirements for a dataset certification policy).
  - Influence on the creation of best practices and guidance (for example, providing recommendations for which connectors should be available via [Data Loss Prevention (DLP)](../../admin/wp-data-loss-prevention.md) policies).
- Actively involve certain champions as satellite members of the CoE. They can provide valuable input in what works and doesn't work when it comes to admin and governance policies, communication, and training.
- Create a feedback loop so champions can easily provide information or submit suggestions to the CoE.

## How to support and reward champions

Your champions give you important insights into the progress and potential pitfalls of your project. Routinely provide recognition and incentives for champions. Not only is praised an effective motivator, but the act of sharing examples of successful efforts can motivate and inspire others.

Supporting and rewarding champions involves providing them with the resources, recognition, and opportunities they need to thrive:

1. **Training and development**: Offer advanced training sessions, workshops, and certifications to help champions deepen their expertise and stay updated with the latest features and best practices.
1. **Recognition programs**: Implement recognition programs that celebrate the achievements of champions, such as awards, certificates, and public acknowledgment during company events.
1. **Access to resources**: Provide champions with access to exclusive resources, such as more powerful connectors, preview features, advanced tools, and dedicated support channels.
1. **Networking opportunities**: Facilitate networking opportunities for champions to connect with other experts, both within and outside the organization. This can include attending conferences, webinars, and community meetups.
1. **Leadership roles**: Encourage champions to take on leadership roles within the community, such as organizing events, leading projects, or mentoring new members.
1. **Feedback and collaboration**: Create channels for champions to provide feedback on the platform and collaborate with the development team to influence future enhancements.
1. **Company benefits**: Is there a company reward or benefit program that their work could tie into? Are there vouchers or other goodies they could receive? Could the benefit even be a premium license or their own environment to play in?
