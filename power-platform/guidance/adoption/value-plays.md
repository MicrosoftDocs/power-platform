# Utilizing value plays to measure and communicate business value

[Measuring and communicating business value](business-value.md) focuses on the app/solution level. Taking a step back and considering the bigger picture of your adoption journey, running specific initiatives can significantly boost adoption by demonstrating how Power Platform can generate business value quickly. But how do you measure and communicate the value of these initiatives? This is where **Value Plays** come into play.

**Value Plays** are strategic initiatives designed to maximize the value delivered by Power Platform. They help you identify high-impact opportunities and execute them effectively to achieve significant outcomes. Here’s how you can apply Value Plays:

1. **Identify high-impact use cases**: Look for scenarios where Power Platform can address critical business challenges or opportunities. These use cases should have the potential to deliver substantial benefits, such as improving efficiency, enhancing customer satisfaction, or driving innovation.
1. **Define clear objectives and metrics**: Establish specific goals for each Value Play and identify the metrics that will be used to measure success. This could include tangible metrics like cost savings and time efficiency, as well as intangible metrics like stakeholder alignment and user satisfaction.
1. **Execute and iterate**: Implement the Value Play by developing and deploying solutions using Power Platform. Continuously gather feedback and iterate on the solution to ensure it meets the defined objectives and delivers the expected value.
1. **Measure and communicate results**: Collect data to measure the impact of the Value Play. Use tools like Power BI to analyze and visualize the results. Communicate the outcomes to stakeholders through clear and concise reports, highlighting both the tangible and intangible benefits achieved.

At a high level, you’ll also need to monitor key value measures or key results to demonstrate ROI at the Power Platform level. This involves tracking metrics that reflect the overall impact of Power Platform on your organization, such as:

- **Adoption rates**: Measure how widely Power Platform is being used across the organization.
- **Efficiency gains**: Track improvements in process efficiency and productivity.
- **Cost savings**: Calculate the financial benefits of using Power Platform compared to traditional development methods.
- **Innovation impact**: Assess how Power Platform is enabling new innovations and business opportunities.

By focusing on these high-level measures, you can provide a comprehensive view of the value generated by Power Platform, supporting your strategic goals and demonstrating ROI effectively. Learn more: [Vision, Metrics & Goals](vision.md)

Each Value Play is designed to be:

- **Strategic**: Begin with Value Plays that are closely aligned with your business objectives. This ensures that the initiatives you undertake are directly contributing to your strategic goals and delivering meaningful outcomes.
- **Repeatable**: Value measurement should be an ongoing process, not a one-time activity. Each Value Play should focus on how Power Platform can continuously enhance existing business processes and programs, creating a sustainable approach to value generation.
- **Actionable**: The philosophy behind Value Plays is to avoid trying to measure everything in the same way. Instead, focus on measuring what matters and ensure that the insights gained are used to drive actionable improvements.

They key components of a Value Play are:

- **Source of value**: Identify where Power Platform can provide unique value. The source of value could be through its low-code capabilities, integration features, or ability to rapidly prototype and deploy solutions.
- **The Play (key activities)**: Outline the specific activities that will be undertaken as part of the Value Play. Your key activities include identifying use cases, developing prototypes, and gathering feedback.
- **Objectives**: Define what you aim to achieve with the Value Play. Your objectives could include improving efficiency, enhancing customer satisfaction, or driving innovation.
- **Audience**: Determine who needs to be informed about the Value Play. Your audience could include stakeholders such as business leaders, IT teams, and end-users.
- **Call to action**: Specify what actions should be taken based on the insights gained from the Value Play. The call to action could involve scaling successful prototypes, making process improvements, or reallocating resources.
- **Value Proposition**:
  - **Strategic Alignment**: Explain how the Value Play supports the broader business goals. This ensures that the initiative is seen as a strategic priority.
  - **Tangibles & Intangibles**: Identify both the tangible and intangible benefits that will be measured. Tangible benefits might include cost savings and time efficiency, while intangible benefits could involve improved stakeholder alignment and user satisfaction.
- **Tips for new players**: Provide guidance on key aspects to get right when implementing Value Plays. This could include selecting the right use cases, engaging stakeholders early, and iterating based on feedback.

These Value Plays are not intended to be an exhaustive list but rather a starting point for creating a simple, repeatable approach to measuring and demonstrating business value. As your use of Power Platform grows and matures, your Value Plays can become more sophisticated, allowing you to capture and communicate even greater value.
