# Empower innovation and AI culture

This article describes a common goal for Power Platformâ€”empowering innovation and AI culture. It follows a [structured framework](../vision.md) that includes defining clear objectives, measurable key results, and actionable initiatives. This article aims to guide you in creating your own vision for Power Platform adoption.

## Vision

Empowering innovation and fostering an AI culture is a common vision for Power Platform adoption because it drives organizational growth, agility, and competitiveness. Power Platform's low-code/no-code capabilities and AI tools democratize innovation, enabling employees at all levels to contribute to digital transformation efforts.

Power Platform allows nontechnical users to create and deploy solutions, breaking down barriers to innovation. This democratization empowers employees to solve their own problems and contribute to the organization's success.

## Objectives

Objectives are the key themes or focus areas that the strategy aims to achieve. They are broad, overarching goals that align with the organizational vision and priorities. Objectives provide direction and set the stage for the initiatives and key results. Objectives help ensure that everyone in the organization understands what the strategy aims to accomplish and why it's important.

Typical objectives for empowering innovation and AI culture include:

- **Foster an inclusive culture of innovation and experimentation**: Create an environment where all employees feel encouraged to innovate and experiment, regardless of their role or technical expertise.
- **Enable rapid and pragmatic delivery**: Equip employees with the tools and processes needed to deliver solutions quickly and effectively.
- **Build a mindset of commitment and self-sufficiency**: Encourage a mindset where employees feel empowered, committed, and self-sufficient in their innovation efforts.
- **Empower businesses to be citizen developers**: Enable business units to develop their own solutions using low-code tools, reducing reliance on IT.
- **Use low-code to challenge legacy technology and processes**: Use low-code development to modernize and improve legacy systems and processes.
- **Create incentives for makers, champions, and departments**: Motivate and recognize contributions to innovation and Power Platform adoption.
- **Start using AI and agents in Power Platform solutions**: Enhance productivity and innovation by integrating AI and Microsoft Copilot Studio features into key areas of Power Platform.
- **Identify citizen developer quick wins**: Demonstrate the value of citizen development through quick, high-impact projects.
- **Encourage leaders to prioritize and allocate time to innovate**: Encourage leaders to prioritize innovation and allocate time for their teams to work on innovative projects.
- **Create a plan for using AI**: Use AI to improve governance, identify inefficiencies, and provide support.
- **Get senior business leaders to advocate for Power Platform**: Engage senior business leaders to champion the Power Platform and advocate for its adoption.
- **Foster Power Platform knowledge among interns and early career professionals**: Develop programs to educate and engage interns and early career professionals in Power Platform development.


## Measurable key results

Key results are specific, quantifiable outcomes that indicate progress towards achieving the strategic objectives. They provide clear benchmarks for success and help in tracking performance. Defining key results is necessary because they offer a way to measure the effectiveness of the initiatives and ensure that the objectives are met. Key results should be realistic, time-bound, and directly linked to the objectives.

Typical key results, aligned with some of the [objectives](#objectives), for empowering innovation and AI culture include:
