Automate routine Platform support activities & request processes (e.g., environment request form). 
Create a Maker Portal with onboarding collateral, development guidelines, self-guided learning, and success stories. 
Reduce Time to Market for PP Apps and Automations: 
Develop automation & alerting for key assurance controls. 
Implement a peer-review mechanism for popular citizen-developed apps. 
Reduce Cost and Effort to License, Build, and Deploy:

Develop Innovative Solutions that Increase Productivity and Drive Our Bottom Line: 
Start using AI/Copilots in platform areas. 
Identify community outreach opportunities - success stories, how to share for awareness tools and process. 
Develop and publish a catalog of reusable app templates & components to help makers build with a reliable, reusable toolkit. 
Break Down Siloes, Process Efficiency, and Unification:
