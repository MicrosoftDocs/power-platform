# Improve the employee experience

It follows a [structured framework](../vision.md) that includes defining clear objectives, measurable key results, and actionable initiatives.

This autonomy fosters a sense of ownership and accomplishment, leading to higher morale and motivation. The platform's collaborative features promote teamwork and knowledge sharing, breaking down silos and creating a more connected and supportive work environment. A better employee experience translates to improved performance, reduced turnover, and a more agile and resilient organization, making it a key driver for adopting Power Platform.
