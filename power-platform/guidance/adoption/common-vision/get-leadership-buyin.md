# Get leadership buy-in and organization alignment

This article describes a common goal for Power Platform—getting leadership buy-in and organization alignment. It follows a [structured framework](../vision.md) that includes defining clear objectives, measurable key results, and actionable initiatives. This article aims to guide you in creating your own vision for Power Platform adoption.

## Vision

[Getting leadership buy-in](../executive-sponsorship.md) and organizational alignment is a common vision for Power Platform adoption because it ensures that the initiative has the necessary support and resources to succeed. Leadership buy-in helps secure funding, allocate resources, and prioritize the adoption efforts within the organization. When leaders are on board, they can champion the initiative, drive cultural change, and set the tone for its importance.

Organizational alignment ensures that all departments and teams are working towards the same goals and understand the benefits of Power Platform. It fosters collaboration, reduces resistance to change, and ensures that the platform is used effectively across the organization. With leadership support and organizational alignment, the adoption process becomes smoother, more efficient, and more likely to deliver the desired outcomes, such as increased productivity, innovation, and return on investment (ROI).

## Objectives

Objectives are the key themes or focus areas that the strategy aims to achieve. They are broad, overarching goals that align with the organizational vision and priorities. Objectives provide direction and set the stage for the initiatives and key results. Objectives help ensure that everyone in the organization understands what the strategy aims to accomplish and why it's important.

Typical objectives for getting leadership buy-in and organization alignment include:

## Measurable key results

Key results are specific, quantifiable outcomes that indicate progress towards achieving the strategic objectives. They provide clear benchmarks for success and help in tracking performance. Defining key results is necessary because they offer a way to measure the effectiveness of the initiatives and ensure that the objectives are met. Key results should be realistic, time-bound, and directly linked to the objectives.
