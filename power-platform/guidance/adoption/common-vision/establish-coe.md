# Establish a Center of Excellence with governance patterns and practices

This article describes a common vision for the Power Platform -  establishing a Center of Excellence (CoE) with robust governance patterns and practices. It follows a [structured framework](../vision.md) that includes defining clear objectives, measurable key results, and actionable initiatives. By detailing this approach, the article aims to guide you in creating your own vision for Power Platform adoption.

## Vision

Establishing a Center of Excellence (CoE) with governance patterns and practices is a common vision for Power Platform adoption because it provides a structured approach to managing and scaling the platform effectively. 

A CoE serves as a centralized team or function that oversees the administration, governance, and nurturing of Power Platform adoption within an organization. By implementing governance patterns and practices, the CoE ensures that the platform is used securely and efficiently, mitigating risks such as compliance and security issues. Additionally, the CoE fosters best practices, educates new makers, and provides a hub for sharing success stories and guidelines. Overall, a CoE with robust governance practices helps organizations maximize the value of their Power Platform investment, driving innovation while maintaining control and compliance.

## Objectives

Objectives are the key themes or focus areas that the strategy aims to achieve. They're broad, overarching goals that align with the organizational vision and priorities. Objectives provide direction and set the stage for the initiatives and key results. Objectives help ensure that everyone in the organization understands what the strategy is aiming to accomplish and why it's important. 

Typical objectives for establishing a Center of Excellence with governance patterns and practices are:

- **Standardize governance patterns and practices**: Establish consistent governance frameworks and best practices to ensure uniformity across the organization. This includes setting up environment strategies, configuring data loss prevention policies, and automating policies using management connectors
- **Document and share governance policies**: Develop comprehensive documentation that outlines governance policies, procedures, and guidelines. Ensure that all stakeholders have access to and understand these documents to maintain consistency and compliance.
- **Define and communicate roles and responsibilities**: Assign specific roles and responsibilities to team members involved in the CoE. Clearly communicate these roles to ensure accountability and effective collaboration. 
- **Foster innovation and trust**: Implement governance practices that encourage innovation while maintaining control and compliance. This includes providing a secure and scalable environment for users to experiment and innovate.
- **Design an onboarding process that doesn't hinder creativity**: Design an onboarding process that is efficient and supportive, allowing new users to quickly get up to speed without stifling their creativity. Provide training and resources to help them understand and adhere to governance policies.
- **Establish a process to evaluate and prioritize use cases**: Establish a structured process for evaluating and prioritizing use cases. This ensures that the most impactful and strategic initiatives are addressed first.
- **Develop an environment strategy**: Develop a well-defined [environment strategy](../../white-papers/environment-strategy.md) that includes guidelines for creating, managing, and decommissioning environments. This helps in maintaining control and ensuring optimal use of resources
- **Provide guidelines for platform maintenance**: Provide guidelines for regular platform maintenance and cleanup to ensure optimal performance and avoid clutter. This includes archiving or deleting unused applications and data.
- **Develop a comprehensive data governance framework**: Ensure data quality, security, and compliance with relevant regulations by establishing a robust data governance framework. This includes defining data ownership, access controls, and data lifecycle management.
- **Govern data connectivity and usage**: Implement policies and controls to govern data connectivity and usage. This ensures that data is accessed and used appropriately, maintaining data integrity and security.
- **Safeguard data and facilitate informed decision making**: Establish privacy policies to protect sensitive data and ensure compliance with data protection regulations. Provide tools and resources to help users make informed decisions about data usage.
- **Define data domains and stewards**: Identify and define data domains within the organization and assign data stewards to oversee and manage these domains. This ensures accountability and effective data management.
- **Define metrics and data-driven improvements**: Establish metrics to measure the effectiveness of governance practices and drive continuous improvement. Use data-driven insights to refine and enhance governance policies.
- **Drive reusability and standardization**: Increase visibility into applications and best practices to promote reusability and standardization. This helps in boosting compliance and ensuring consistent quality across the organization.
- **Develop a decision matrix for platform and license selection**: Develop a decision matrix tool to guide the selection of appropriate platforms and licenses based on specific use cases and requirements. This ensures optimal resource allocation and cost management
- **Strive for continuous improvement**: Establish a clear pathway for decision-making that aligns policy and continuous process improvement to maximize technology capabilities. This includes regular reviews and updates to governance policies based on feedback and evolving business needs

## Measurable key results

Key results are specific, quantifiable outcomes that indicate progress towards achieving the strategic objectives. They provide clear benchmarks for success and help in tracking performance. Defining key results is necessary because they offer a way to measure the effectiveness of the initiatives and ensure that the objectives are being met. Key results should be realistic, time-bound, and directly linked to the objectives. 

Typical key results, aligned with some of the [objectives](#objectives), for establishing a Center of Excellence with governance patterns and practices are:
