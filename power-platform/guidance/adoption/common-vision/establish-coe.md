## Key initiatives

Standardization of governance patterns & practices: 
Establish Governance and best practice. 
Define and implement ALM processes to streamline and manage app deployments. 
Develop and publish a catalogue of reusable app templates & components to help makers build with a reliable, reusable toolkit. 
Documentation of the DLP policies, environment strategy, intake. 
Publish strategy and version-controlled governance documentation. 
Create a Maker Portal with onboarding collateral, development guidelines, self-guided learning, and success stories. 
Establish environment strategy. 
Define app classifications and the Environment Strategy/DLP safeguards to support them. 
Establish foundational Platform operating roles to provide clarity on ‘who does what’ to manage the platform. 
Monitoring 
Create dashboards for successful adoption metrics. 
Build dashboards to monitor and analyze platform license consumption and usage. 
Platform cleanup guidance: 
Measure & understand default environment cleanup work. 
Tidy up unused apps, flows, and environments from the tenant and reassign ownership of orphaned team apps/flows still in active use. 
Implement and continue default environment cleanup. 
Develop a comprehensive data governance framework that ensures data quality, security, and compliance with relevant regulations: 
Define a data strategy that captures the lifecycle of data. 
Partner with the security team to align on roles and responsibilities. 
Work with cybersecurity to plan & implement security monitoring routines. 
Define data sensitivity & security assessment expectations for makers. 
Create an approved catalogue of connectors to LOB systems to remove integration friction and better utilize authoritative data sources. 
Define data domains and stewards. 
Establish Data Management for each app and determine the type of data – PII, SPII, CIL, and records retention policies. 
Drive reusability and standardization by increasing visibility into applications and best practices in order to boost compliance: 
Publish 'when to use what' guidance to align expectations on what app development can be done on the platform. 
Create and sustain an online Community of Practice for Power Platform practitioners, establishing ideation, support & mentorship. 
Establish themes/trends to guide the development of reusable components/toolkits. 
Safeguard Data & Facilitate Informed Decision-Making: 
Establish DLP Policies. 
Align on common DLP baseline with tracked divergence where necessary. 
Develop automation & alerting for key assurance controls. 
Onboarding process that does not hinder creativity: 
Create a Maker Portal with onboarding collateral, development guidelines, self-guided learning, and success stories. 
Resolve barriers by creating training and Tiered Certification Programs – starter toolbox – with gamification and other incentives. 
Develop an onboarding newsletter to citizen developers to guide them on Power Platform governance and training resources. 
Clear use case intake and prioritization: 
Establish App Intake Process. 
Decision Matrix tool for platform and license selection: 
Build out “for this, do that” decision tree. 
Create decision matrix and incorporate it into the helpdesk request system. 
Start the baseline of decision trees/matrix for developers. 
Pathway to decision making to align policy and continuous process improvement to maximize technology capabilities: 
Develop a project pre/postmortem process to ensure lessons learnt are being actively applied. 
Establish routine (CoE) monitoring to ensure full visibility of what the platform is being used for. 
Create transparency/monitoring loop on the objectives – formalize the efforts, align to goals. 
Clearly defined and communicated roles and responsibilities:
