# Establish a Center of Excellence with governance patterns and practices

Establishing a Center of Excellence (CoE) with governance patterns and practices is a common goal for Power Platform adoption because it provides a structured approach to managing and scaling the platform effectively. 

A CoE serves as a centralized team or function that oversees the administration, governance, and nurturing of Power Platform adoption within an organization. By implementing governance patterns and practices, the CoE ensures that the platform is used securely and efficiently, mitigating risks such as compliance and security issues. Additionally, the CoE fosters best practices, educates new makers, and provides a hub for sharing success stories and guidelines. Overall, a CoE with robust governance practices helps organizations maximize the value of their Power Platform investment, driving innovation while maintaining control and compliance.

## Objectives

Objectives are the key themes or focus areas that the strategy aims to achieve. They're broad, overarching goals that align with the organizational vision and priorities. Objectives provide direction and set the stage for the initiatives and key results. Objectives help ensure that everyone in the organization understands what the strategy is aiming to accomplish and why it's important. 

Example objectives for establishing a Center of Excellence with governance patterns and practices are:

- Standardization of governance patterns & practices 
- Governance Documentation and shared understanding 
- Clearly defined and communicated roles and responsibilities 
- Governance that Fosters Innovation & Trust
- Onboarding process that doesn't hinder creativity 
- Clear use case intake and prioritization 
- Have a clear environment strategy 
- Platform cleanup guidance 
- Develop a comprehensive data governance framework that ensures data quality, security, and compliance with relevant regulations 
- Governed data connectivity & usage 
- Privacy - Safeguard Data & Facilitate Informed Decision-Making 
- Define data domains and stewards 
- Define Metrics & Data Driven Improvement 
- Drive reusability and standardization by increasing visibility into applications and best practices boost compliance 
- Decision Matrix tool for platform and license selection 
- Pathway to decision making to align policy and continuous process improvement to maximize technology capabilities 

## Measurable key results

Key results are specific, quantifiable outcomes that indicate progress towards achieving the strategic objectives. They provide clear benchmarks for success and help in tracking performance. Defining key results is necessary because they offer a way to measure the effectiveness of the initiatives and ensure that the objectives are being met. Key results should be realistic, time-bound, and directly linked to the objectives. 

Example key results for establishing a Center of Excellence with governance patterns and practices are:

    - Standardize solutions and strengthen governance in the COE, ensuring consistent operations, compliance, and a ___% faster delivery of results. 

## Key initiatives

Initiatives are the specific actions or projects that need to be implemented to achieve the objectives. They outline what needs to be done in the immediate term, in the next year and in the next three years. Initiatives provide a roadmap for action and ensure that there's a clear plan in place to reach the objectives. Initiatives should be actionable, prioritized, and aligned with the key results.
