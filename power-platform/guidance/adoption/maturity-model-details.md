# Power Platform Adoption Maturity Model: Detailed capabilities

The goal of the Adoption Maturity Model is to help define a roadmap for Power Platform adoption. The roadmap presents a series of strategic and tactical considerations and action items that directly lead to successful Power Platform adoption.

Advancing adoption and cultivating a low-code culture is about more than implementing technology features. Technology can assist an organization in making the greatest impact, but a healthy low-code culture involves a lot of considerations across the spectrum of people, processes, and technology.

The aim of the Adoption Maturity Model is to provide organizations and their partners with a way to think through how they can improve their capabilities and decide which capabilities matter most to them. Each stage describes the states of individual disciplines such as Strategy & Vision, Administration, Governance, etc. The purpose of the model is to help organizations understand their capabilities along multiple dimensions on a clearly defined scale, decide which level they would like to achieve for each dimension and in what time frame, and improve their capabilities in tangible ways by progressing to the next level.

Find below detailed characteristics and capabilities of an organization in each stage:

## Power Platform adoption

Successful Power Platform adoption involves making effective processes, support, tools, and data available to makers and end users.

A common misconception is that adoption relates primarily to usage or the number of users. There's no question that usage statistics are an important factor. However, usage is not the only factor. Adoption is not just about using the technology on a regular basis; it's about using it *effectively*. Effectiveness is much harder to define and measure.

Whenever possible, adoption efforts should be aligned across low-code platforms, and other Power Platform products, such as Power BI.

> [!NOTE]
> Individuals—and the organization itself—are continually learning, changing, and improving. That means there's no formal end to adoption-related efforts.

## Target audience

The intended audience of the Adoption Maturity Model is interested in one or more of the following outcomes:

- Improving their organization's ability to effectively use Power Platform.
- Increasing their organization's maturity level related to Power Platform delivery.
- Understanding and overcoming adoption-related challenges faced when scaling Power Platform.
- Increasing their organization's return on investment (ROI) in Power Platform.

Primarily, this series of articles will be helpful to those who work in an organization with one or more of the following characteristics:

- Power Platform is deployed with some successes.
- Power Platform has pockets of viral adoption, but is not purposefully governed across the entire organization.
- Power Platform is deployed with some meaningful scale, but there remains a need to determine:
  - What is effective and what should be maintained.
  - What should be improved.
  - How future deployments could be more strategic.
- Expanded adoption of Power Platform is under consideration or is planned.

Secondarily, this series of articles will be helpful for:

- Organizations that are in the early stages of a Power Platform adoption.
- Organizations that have had success with adoption and now want to evaluate their current maturity level.

## Assumptions and scope

The primary focus of this series of articles is on the Power Platform technology platform, with an emphasis on the Power Apps, Power Automate, Power Virtual Agents and Dataverse.

For information about Power BI adoption, see the [Power BI Adoption Roamdap](/power-bi/guidance/powerbi-adoption-roadmap-overview).

## Next steps

In the articles in this series, learn about the Power Platform adoption maturity levels. The maturity levels are referenced throughout the entire series of articles. Also, see the conclusion article for additional adoption-related resources.

- Upskilling? See [Power Platform In a day workshops](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com/instructor-led-training/) and [Power Platform on Microsoft Learn](/learn/powerplatform/)
- Experienced Power Platform partners are available to help your organization succeed with adoption of Power Platform. To engage a Power Platform partner, visit the [Power Apps partner portal](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/partners/).
