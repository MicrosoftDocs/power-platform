# Power Platform adoption maturity model: Detailed capabilities

The adoption maturity model helps define a roadmap for Microsoft Power Platform adoption. The roadmap includes strategic and tactical considerations and action items that lead to successful Power Platform adoption.

To advance adoption and cultivate a low-code culture, you need to do more than implement technology features. Technology helps organizations make a significant impact, but a healthy low-code culture depends on people, processes, and technology.

The adoption maturity model helps organizations and their partners evaluate and prioritize their capabilities. Each stage describes the states of individual disciplines such as strategy and vision, administration, governance, and so on. The purpose of the model is to help organizations understand their capabilities across the multiple dimensions, decide the level they would like to achieve for each dimension and the timeline, and improve their capabilities in tangible ways by progressing to the next level. The following sections present detailed characteristics and capabilities of an organization at each stage.

## Power Platform adoption

Successful Power Platform adoption involves making effective processes, support, tools, and data available to makers and users.

A common misconception is that adoption relates primarily to usage or the number of users. While usage statistics are important, adoption isn't just about regular use; it's about using the technology *effectively*. Effectiveness is harder to define and measure.

Whenever possible, align adoption efforts across low-code platforms and other Power Platform products, such as Power BI.

> [!NOTE]  
> Individuals and the organization itself are continually learning, changing, and improving. There's no formal end to adoption efforts.  

## Target audience

The intended audience of the adoption maturity model is interested in one or more of the following outcomes:

- Improving their organization's ability to effectively use Power Platform.  
- Increasing their organization's maturity level related to Power Platform delivery.  
- Understanding and overcoming challenges related to adoption when scaling Power Platform.  
- Increasing their organization's return on investment (ROI) in Power Platform.  

Primarily, this series of articles is helpful to those who work in an organization with one or more of the following characteristics:

- Power Platform is deployed with some successes.  
- Power Platform has pockets of viral adoption, but isn't purposefully governed across the entire organization.  
- Power Platform is deployed at a meaningful scale, but it's important to determine:  
    - What is effective and should be maintained
    - What needs improvement
    - How to make future deployments more strategic 
- Expanded adoption of Power Platform is under consideration or is planned.  

This series of articles is also helpful for:

- Organizations that are in the early stages of a Power Platform adoption.  
- Organizations that have had success with adoption and now want to evaluate their current maturity level.  

## Assumptions and scope

This series of articles focuses on the Power Platform technology platform, with the emphasis on Power Apps, Power Automate, Microsoft Copilot Studio, and Microsoft Dataverse.
