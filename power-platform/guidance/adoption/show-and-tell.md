# Share success stories

## Organize show-and-tell sessions

If you want to create more excitement in your organization and inspire more people to join your Power Apps community, an app showcase is a great way to do so. Teams meet to demo what they've built, share problems they've solved, and show the impact they've created with the apps they've made.

It's an opportunity for other teams and makers to see the impact of digital culture, and the business value they could add by joining the Power Apps community.

Here are a few lessons for organizing successful and impactful show-and-tell sessions:

- Make them part of existing company events, such as townhall meetings or more general tech showcases. This would ensure a wide variety of people attend and see your apps.

- Encourage a variety of different makers and problems to be showcased; don't show five "form over paper" apps, but focus on different use cases—an app, a flow, a dashboard, a chatbot.

- Ensure makers with different backgrounds attend to emphasize that Microsoft Power Platform is for everyone.

- Provide just a brief overview of the app, and allow time for questions.

- Record the app showcase and make it available as a webinar—for example, on Microsoft Stream—to further the reach in your organization.

## Publish case studies as a newsletter

Celebrate your makers and champions by sharing their success stories, and focus on the business value and impact they have on the organization. Did the solution they build save money, time, or paper? Did it increase employee or customer satisfaction? Ensure to include some metrics when you share the story! Focus not just on the solution, but also on the maker—what's their background, how did they learn about Microsoft Power Platform, and what was their upskilling journey like.

Look at our [public case studies](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/category/case-studies/) to find inspiration on how to structure your success stories.

Here are some tips for writing and sharing success stories:

- Know in advance the two or three key nuggets for the story that you want to make sure are highlighted. For example, is this about the personal journey of the app maker, is it about the business value, is it about the unique scenario, is it about the technical complexity, is it about a particular usage pattern?

- Write the story from the standpoint of a reader who doesn't know anything about the process or the solution. One way to do this is to use examples of actual users in various situations using the app and technologies.

- Use images to showcase the great work you've done. It's great to have images from the before process and then images showing the new process and different technologies used.

- Include a screenshot of the flow, the canvas app in Edit Mode, or the Power BI data model or dashboard.

- Provide quotes from the leadership team and users; this is a great way to highlight the impact of your work.

- Use a format that makes sense for your story, but here is an example format that we use for our public case studies:

  - **Overview**: Summary of what was accomplished at a high level.
  
  - **Business scenario**: Key problem that had to be solved.
  
  - **Before process**: Summary of business process, challenges, and opportunities.
  
  - **Solution**: Microsoft Power Platform solutions that have solved for a better process.
  
  - **Impact and benefits**: Bullet point summary of time, cost, productivity, and benefits.
  
  - **Solution architecture**: Summary of screenshots of technologies used and how they all connect.
  
  - **Meet the team**: Highlight the team members who made this possible. (*The best part!*)
  
- Have *fun* writing your story; it’s a great way to showcase your work and have documentation of what you achieved.

Share your success stories in a regular Microsoft Power Platform newsletter, highlight them on your intranet, or record an interview with the maker to upload and share with your maker community.

Here's an example of how you could share the solution architecture:
