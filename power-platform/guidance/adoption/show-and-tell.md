# Share success stories

When your organization adopts Microsoft Power Platform, sharing success stories internally becomes a powerful tool to foster engagement, inspire innovation, and drive adoption. Success stories highlight the tangible benefits of the platform, showcase the achievements of your makers, and create a culture of recognition and continuous improvement.

1. **Inspiration and motivation**: Success stories serve as a source of inspiration for other team members. They demonstrate what is possible with Power Platform and motivate others to explore and use its capabilities.
1. **Knowledge sharing**: By sharing detailed accounts of successful projects, you facilitate knowledge transfer within the organization. This helps others learn from the experiences and best practices of their peers.
1. **Recognition and morale boost**: Celebrating the achievements of individuals and teams boosts morale and fosters a sense of pride and accomplishment. Recognized employees are more likely to stay engaged and committed to their work.
1. **Building a community**: Success stories help build a sense of community among makers. They create connections and encourage collaboration, leading to a more cohesive and supportive environment.
1. **Driving adoption**: Highlighting successful use cases of Power Platform can accelerate the adoption across the organization. When employees see the positive effect on their peers' work, they're more likely to embrace the platform themselves.

## How to identify valuable success stories

To ensure the success stories you share are impactful, consider the following criteria:

1. **Relevance**: Choose stories that are relevant to the organization's goals and the interests of your audience. Focus on projects that address key business challenges or opportunities.
1. **Impact**: Highlight stories that demonstrate significant positive outcomes, such as increased efficiency, cost savings, improved customer satisfaction, or innovative solutions.
1. **Diversity**: Share various stories that showcase different aspects of Power Platform, and different use cases. Highlight contributions from makers with diverse backgrounds, such as those from business and pro-dev environments. This helps illustrate the platform's versatility and its ability to cater to a wide range of skills and perspectives.
1. **Engagement**: Select stories that involve active collaboration and engagement from multiple stakeholders. These stories emphasize the collaborative nature of the platform and its ability to bring teams together.
1. **Scalability**: Highlight projects that have the potential to be scaled or replicated across the organization. This encourages others to adopt similar approaches and solutions.

## How to share success stories

There are several effective ways to share success stories within your organization:

### Organize show and tell sessions

Organize town hall meetings or webinars where makers can present their projects and share their success stories. This provides a platform for live interaction and Q&A sessions.

If you want to create more excitement in your organization and inspire more people to join your Power Platform community, a solution showcase is a great way to do so. Teams meet to demo what they built, share problems they solved, and show the impact they created with the solutions they made.

It's an opportunity for other teams and makers to see the impact of digital culture, and the business value they could add by joining the Power Platform community.

Here are a few lessons for organizing successful and impactful show and tell sessions:

- Make them part of existing company events, such as townhall meetings or more general tech showcases. This would ensure a wide variety of people attend and see your solutions.

- Encourage various different makers and problems to be showcased; don't show five "form over paper" apps, but focus on different use cases—an app, a flow, a dashboard, an agent.

- Ensure makers with different backgrounds attend to emphasize that Microsoft Power Platform is for everyone.

- Provide a PowerPoint template for makers to use during show & tell sessions. The template should include slides for: 
    - Architecture: Outline the different components of the platform. 
    - Problem: Describe the issue being addressed. 
    - Current solution: Detail the existing solution. 
    - Business value: Highlight cost savings and impact. 

- Provide just a brief overview of the solution, and allow time for questions.

- Record the solution showcase and make it available as a webinar—for example, on Microsoft Stream—to further the reach in your organization.

### Publish case studies as a newsletter

Celebrate your makers and champions by sharing their success stories, and focus on the business value and impact they have on the organization. Did the solution they build save money, time, or paper? Did it increase employee or customer satisfaction? Ensure to include some metrics when you share the story! Focus not just on the solution, but also on the maker—what's their background, how did they learn about Microsoft Power Platform, and what was their upskilling journey like.

Look at our [public customer stories](https://www.microsoft.com/customers/search?filters=product%3Amicrosoft-power-platform) to find inspiration on how to structure your success stories.

Here are some tips for writing and sharing success stories:

- Know in advance the two or three key nuggets for the story that you want to make sure are highlighted. For example, is this about the personal journey of the app maker, is it about the business value, is it about the unique scenario, is it about the technical complexity, is it about a particular usage pattern?

- Write the story from the standpoint of a reader who doesn't know anything about the process or the solution. One way to do this is to use examples of actual users in various situations using the app and technologies.

- Use images to showcase the great work you've done. It's great to have images from the before process and then images showing the new process and different technologies used.

- Include a screenshot of the flow, the canvas app in Edit Mode, or the Power BI data model or dashboard.

- Provide quotes from the leadership team and users; this is a great way to highlight the impact of your work.

- Use a format that makes sense for your story. Here's an example format that we use for our public case studies:

  - **Overview**: Summary of what was accomplished at a high level.
  
  - **Business scenario**: Key problem that had to be solved.
  
  - **Before process**: Summary of business process, challenges, and opportunities.
  
  - **Solution**: How the Power Platform solution has improved the process.
  
  - **Impact and benefits**: Bullet point summary of time, cost, productivity, and benefits.
  
  - **Solution architecture**: Summary of screenshots of technologies used and how they all connect.
  
  - **Meet the team**: Highlight the team members who made this possible. (*The best part!*)
  
- Have *fun* writing your story; it’s a great way to showcase your work and have documentation of what you achieved.

Share your success stories in a regular Microsoft Power Platform newsletter, highlight them on your intranet, or record an interview with the maker to upload and share with your maker community.
