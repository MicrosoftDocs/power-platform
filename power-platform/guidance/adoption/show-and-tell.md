# Share success stories

When your organization adopts Microsoft Power Platform, sharing success stories internally fosters engagement, inspires innovation, and drives adoption. Success stories highlight the tangible benefits of the platform, showcase the achievements of your makers, and create a culture of recognition and continuous improvement.

- **Inspiration and motivation**: Success stories serve as a source of inspiration for other team members. They demonstrate what is possible with Power Platform and motivate others to explore and use its capabilities.
- **Knowledge sharing**: Sharing detailed accounts of successful projects facilitates knowledge transfer within the organization, helping others learn from peer experiences and best practices.
- **Recognition and morale boost**: Celebrating individual and team achievements boosts morale, fosters pride, and keeps employees engaged and committed.
- **Building a community**: Success stories help build a sense of community among makers. They create connections and encourage collaboration, leading to a more cohesive and supportive environment.
- **Driving adoption**: Highlighting successful Power Platform use cases accelerates adoption. Employees are more likely to embrace the platform when they see its positive impact on peers' work.

## How to identify valuable success stories

To ensure the success stories you share are impactful, consider the following criteria:

- **Relevance**: Choose stories that are relevant to the organization's goals and the interests of your audience. Focus on projects that address key business challenges or opportunities.
- **Impact**: Highlight stories that demonstrate significant positive outcomes, such as increased efficiency, cost savings, improved customer satisfaction, or innovative solutions.
- **Diversity**: Share stories that showcase different aspects of Power Platform and various use cases. Highlight contributions from makers with diverse backgrounds, including those from business and pro-dev environments. This approach illustrates the platform's versatility and ability to cater to a wide range of skills and perspectives.
- **Engagement**: Select stories that involve active collaboration and engagement from multiple stakeholders. These stories emphasize the collaborative nature of the platform and its ability to bring teams together.
- **Scalability**: Highlight projects that can be scaled or replicated across the organization to encourage others to adopt similar solutions.

## How to share success stories

There are several effective ways to share success stories within your organization.

- Organize town hall meetings or webinars where makers can present their projects and share their success stories. These events provide a platform for live interaction and Q&A sessions.

- To create excitement in your organization and inspire more people to join your Power Platform community, host a solution showcase. Teams meet to demo their solutions, share problems they solved, and demonstrate the impact they created with the solutions they made.

- Provide an opportunity for other teams and makers to see the impact of digital culture, and the business value they could add by joining the Power Platform community.

- Organize show and tell sessions to highlight the work of your makers. 

### Organize show and tell sessions

Here are a few tips for organizing successful and impactful show and tell sessions:

- Include show and tell sessions in existing company events, such as townhall meetings or general tech showcases, to ensure wide exposure.

- Showcase diverse makers and problems&mdash;avoid showing five "form over paper" apps. Instead, focus on different use cases like an app, a flow, a dashboard, or an agent.

- Ensure makers with different backgrounds attend to emphasize that Power Platform is for everyone.

- Provide a PowerPoint template for makers to use during show and tell sessions. The template should include slides for: 
    - Architecture: Outline the different components of the platform
    - Problem: Describe the issue being addressed
    - Current solution: Detail the existing solution
    - Business value: Highlight cost savings and impact

- Provide a brief overview of the solution and allow time for questions.

- Record the session and make it available as a webinar, such as on Microsoft Stream, to expand its reach within your organization.

### Celebrate the success of your makers and champions

Celebrate your makers and champions by sharing their success stories. Focus on the business value they bring to the organization. Did their solution save money, time, or paper? Did it improve employee or customer satisfaction? Be sure to include metrics when you share the story. Focus not only on the solution, but also on the makerâ€”their background, how they learned about Power Platform, and their upskilling journey.

Find inspiration on how to structure your success stories in our [public customer stories](https://www.microsoft.com/customers/search?filters=product%3Amicrosoft-power-platform).

Here are some tips:

- Identify two or three key points to highlight in the story. For example, is it about the app maker's personal journey, the business value, a unique scenario, the technical complexity, or a specific usage pattern?

- Write the story for an audience unfamiliar with the process or solution. For example, show how actual users interact with the app and technologies in different situations.

- Use images to showcase the story. Include images of the process before and after, highlighting the new technologies used.

- Include a screenshot of the flow, the canvas app in Edit Mode, or the Power BI data model or dashboard.

- Include quotes from the leadership team and users to highlight impact.

- Use a format that makes sense for your story. Here's an example format that we use for our public case studies:

  - **Overview**: Summary of what was accomplished at a high level.  
  - **Business scenario**: Key problem to solve.  
  - **Before process**: Summary of business process, challenges, and opportunities.  
  - **Solution**: How the Power Platform solution improved the process.  
  - **Impact and benefits**: Bullet point summary of time, cost, productivity, and benefits.  
  - **Solution architecture**: Summary of screenshots of technologies used and how they all connect.  
  - **Meet the team**: Highlight the team members who made this possible. (*The best part!*)
  
- Have fun writing your story! It's a great way to showcase the efforts and document achievements.

Share your success stories in a Microsoft Power Platform newsletter, highlight them on your intranet, or record an interview with the maker to upload and share with your maker community.
