# Implement delivery models

Defining a structured delivery and organization model is essential for driving successful Power Platform adoption within your organization. A well-defined model establishes [clear roles and responsibilities](roles.md), which help foster collaboration and innovation. By outlining how different teams and individuals interact with Power Platform, organizations can ensure that resources are effectively utilized, and projects are aligned with strategic objectives. This structured approach not only enhances efficiency and accountability but also supports compliance with regulatory requirements and promotes a culture of continuous improvement.

We observe four primary delivery models across various customers. However, it's important to note that these models are conceptual frameworks, and in practice, organizations often implement a blend of these approaches. For instance, even if an organization adopts a centralized model where a central delivery team handles all requirements, there are citizen developers within the organization who explore the platform and create solutions for their specific teams. This means that elements of other models, such as matrix or BizDevOps, naturally emerge. Therefore, while these delivery models provide a useful starting point, each organization typically develop a unique combination that best fits its needs and context.

Reflect on your current software delivery model and how Power Platform can integrate with or transform it. These models serve as a framework to understand how Power Platform's rapid development capabilities can be used within your existing processes. For instance, if your organization currently follows a centralized delivery model, integrating Power Platform might involve establishing a central team to manage and govern the platform while enabling citizen developers to create solutions within their departments. This approach can enhance agility and innovation without compromising control and oversight.

Alternatively, if your organization uses a decentralized or federated model, Power Platform can empower individual teams to develop and deploy solutions quickly, fostering a culture of innovation and responsiveness. In this scenario, the role of a central governance team involve setting standards, providing support, and ensuring compliance across the organization.

As your organization evolves, you might find that a hybrid approach, blending elements of different delivery models, best suits your needs. This flexibility allows you to adapt to changing requirements and scale your Power Platform adoption effectively.

## Centralized  

In a centralized model, central teams of product owners are responsible for the low-code delivery of departmental solutions across the organization's business units. Professional developers collaborate with the business to deliver solutions in a shared model. Enterprise architects manage the middle tier and services, ensuring data availability for makers. Central IT oversees licensing and the systems in which everyone operates.

This model allows a central team to prioritize and develop solutions based on organizational needs. With foundational expertise in Power Platform, the team can include specialists in various components of the platform, such as Copilot studio, Power Automate, Power BI, and the Power Apps component framework, as well as third-party integration and artificial intelligence. This centralized approach can effectively drive change across the organization and deliver a wide range of applications.

However, it's important to note that while the centralized model has its advantages, it may not be the best fit for every organization. Typically, a hybrid approach, which combines elements of centralized and decentralized models, is more effective. A hybrid model allows for greater flexibility, enabling individual teams to innovate and respond quickly to their specific needs while maintaining central oversight and governance. This balance ensures that the organization can scale its Power Platform adoption efficiently and sustainably.

Some key benefits of a decentralized delivery model are:

- **Consistency**: Centralized teams can ensure that all solutions adhere to organizational standards and best practices, leading to uniform quality and compliance.
- **Governance**: With a central team overseeing development, it's easier to implement and enforce governance policies, such as data security, compliance, and resource management.
- **Resource efficiency**: Centralizing resources allows for more efficient allocation and utilization, reducing redundancy and optimizing costs.
- **Expertise concentration**: A central team can develop deep expertise in Power Platform components, providing specialized knowledge and support to the entire organization.
- **Strategic alignment**: Centralized control ensures that all projects align with the organization's strategic goals and priorities, facilitating coordinated efforts and avoiding conflicting initiatives.
- **Simplified management**: Managing a single, central team can be simpler and more straightforward than coordinating multiple decentralized teams.

While a centralized approach to Power Platform adoption has its benefits, it also comes with several challanges:

- **Bottlenecks**: Centralized teams can become overwhelmed with requests, leading to delays and slower response times for project delivery.
- **Limited innovation**: Centralized control can stifle creativity and innovation, as teams may feel less empowered to experiment and develop solutions independently.
- **Reduced agility**: A centralized model can be less flexible and slower to adapt to changing needs and priorities, as all decisions and developments must go through a central team.
- **Resource constraints**: Central teams might struggle to manage the diverse needs of the entire organization, leading to resource allocation challenges and potential neglect of smaller projects.
- **Dependency**: Relying heavily on a central team can create a single point of failure, where issues within the central team can impact the entire organization's ability to develop and deploy solutions.
- **Lack of business expertise**: Centralized teams might not have the same level of understanding of specific departmental needs and challenges, leading to solutions that are less tailored and effective.
- **Employee disengagement**: Teams might feel less ownership and involvement in the development process, potentially leading to lower engagement and satisfaction.

## Decentralized

In a decentralized delivery model, multiple teams are established across the organization, each closely aligned with the day-to-day operations of various departments. These teams are equipped with the resources needed to consistently deliver apps within organizational guidelines. Operating autonomously, they can adapt and expand in a cellular fashion, allowing for flexibility and rapid response to specific needs.

Despite the autonomy of these teams, centralized governance remains essential to ensure corporate compliance and maintain high-level digital guardrails. This includes implementing data loss prevention (DLP) policies, managing connectors, and overseeing license management. These measures enable users and developers to build and release solutions safely and efficiently, with minimal intervention from IT, while safeguarding company data.

The decentralized model is an excellent self-service option, empowering teams to innovate and address their unique challenges while maintaining overall organizational standards and compliance. This approach fosters a culture of agility and responsiveness, driving successful Power Platform adoption across the enterprise.

Key benefits of a decentralized delivery model are:

- **Increased agility**: Teams can quickly respond to their specific needs and challenges, leading to faster development and deployment of solutions.
- **Enhanced innovation**: By empowering individual teams, the model fosters a culture of creativity and experimentation, driving innovation across the organization.
- **Scalability**: Teams can grow and adapt in a cellular fashion, allowing the organization to scale its Power Platform adoption efficiently.
- **Autonomy**: Teams operate independently, making decisions and managing their projects without waiting for central approval, which can streamline processes and reduce bottlenecks.
- **Closer alignment with business needs**: Teams that are closely aligned with day-to-day operations can develop solutions that are more tailored to the specific needs of their departments.
- **Resource optimization**: Decentralized teams can apply their unique expertise and resources, optimizing the use of organizational assets.
- **Employee empowerment**: Giving teams the autonomy to manage their projects can increase job satisfaction and engagement, as employees feel more empowered and responsible for their work.

Challenges of a decentralized delivery model include:

- **Consistency**: Ensuring that all teams adhere to organizational standards and guidelines can be difficult, leading to potential inconsistencies in app quality and compliance.
- **Governance**: Maintaining effective governance across multiple autonomous teams requires robust oversight mechanisms to ensure data security, compliance, and proper use of resources.
