# Promote the community & establish partnerships

## Design your community brand

Creating a strong and recognizable brand for your Power Platform community helps convey the community's identity, values, and purpose, making it easier to attract and engage members. Here are four key steps to designing your community brand, based on the image provided:

1. **Give your community a name**: The first step in designing your community brand is to choose a name that reflects its purpose and values. A memorable and meaningful name helps establish the community's identity and makes it easier for potential members to understand what the community is about. For example, "Power Innovator Hub" clearly conveys a focus on innovation and collaboration within the Power Platform ecosystem.
1. **Design an easy-to-recognize community logo**: A distinctive and recognizable logo can visually represent the community's identity and be easily identifiable across various platforms and materials. Consider incorporating elements related to Power Platform, such as icons or symbols, to create a strong visual connection. Ensure the logo is versatile and works well in different sizes and formats.
1. **Select a community colour scheme**: Choose a consistent color scheme that creates a cohesive and professional look for your community brand. Refer to your business brand guidelines to select colors that align with your organization's overall branding. Use these colors consistently across all community-related content.
1. **Consider your brand "voice"**: Your community's brand voice is the tone and style of communication used in all interactions and content. It should reflect the community's values and personality. For example, your brand voice could be inspiring, encouraging, collaborative, fun, or welcoming. Consistency in your brand voice helps build trust and familiarity with your audience.

## Promote your community

Promoting your Power Platform community effectively helps attract new members, fosters engagement, and establishes valuable partnerships. Here are several communication channels and promotional methods to help you spread the word about your community and ensure its growth and success.

- **Dedicated intranet page or sub-site**: Create a dedicated intranet page or sub-site for your community. This centralized hub can provide essential information, resources, and updates, making it easy for members to stay informed and engaged.

- **Featured posts and news**: Use featured posts and news articles to highlight community activities, achievements, and upcoming events. Sharing success stories and member contributions can inspire others to join and participate actively.
- **Leadership endorsement at existing IT forums**: Secure endorsements from leadership. Having leaders speak positively about the community and its benefits can lend credibility and encourage more members to get involved.
- **Email newsletters**: Send regular email newsletters to keep members informed about the latest news, events, and opportunities within the community. Newsletters can also feature member spotlights, success stories, and valuable resources.
- **Viva Engage**: Use Viva Engage to foster connections and collaboration within the community. This platform can help facilitate discussions, share updates, and provide a space for members to interact and support each other.
- **Other communities & joint events**: Collaborate with other communities and organize joint events. Partnering with related groups can expand your reach, attract new members, and create opportunities for cross-community learning and networking.
- **Posters & digital signage**: Use posters and digital signage to promote your community within your organization. 
- **Company all-hands**: Take advantage of company all-hands meetings to promote your community. Presenting at these gatherings can help raise awareness and highlight the community's value to a broader audience.
- **Information booth**: Set up an information booth at company events or in common areas. This booth can provide materials, answer questions, and engage potential members in person.
- **Word-of-mouth**: Encourage existing members to spread the word about the community. Personal recommendations and word-of-mouth can be powerful tools for attracting new members and building a strong, engaged community.
- **Member recommendations**: Use member recommendations to promote the community. Encourage members to share their positive experiences and invite colleagues to join. Testimonials and endorsements from current members can be highly persuasive.
