# Offer solution envisioning workshops

Have you heard from colleagues who have attended a [Microsoft Power Platform training event](in-a-day.md) and now want to use Power Apps to solve a business problem but don’t know where to start? Do they have an idea in mind, but perhaps haven't fully thought through all the details and information they need to create an app?

The articles in [Planning a Power Apps project](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/guidance/planning/introduction) can teach you how to convert an idea into a fully working solution by using Power Apps.

Use the materials to organize solution envisioning workshops with makers and help them plan and execute their Power Apps projects. This could be a great add-on to an App in a Day event that you are running internally.
