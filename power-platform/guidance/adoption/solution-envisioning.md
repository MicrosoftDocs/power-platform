# Envision and uncover high-value Power Platform use cases

Investing in the Power Platform involves both time and resources. By identifying areas where the platform can enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and improve decision-making, organizations can ensure they are leveraging the technology to its fullest potential. High-value use cases often involve automating repetitive tasks, providing real-time data insights, and streamlining processes, which collectively boost employee productivity and job satisfaction.

Solution envisioning workshops are an effective way to uncover high-value use cases by bringing together stakeholders to collaboratively explore opportunities and define solutions. This article will guide you through organizing these workshops and the activities involved in identifying and refining high-value use cases.

>[!TIP]
> Review the guidance on [measuring the value of Power Platform solutions](business-value.md) to understand how you can measure and report both tangible and intangible value, and learn from example value measurements.

## Organizing solution envisioning workshops

1. **Define objectives and scope**: Clearly define the goals of the workshop. Are you looking to improve a specific process, explore opportunities to use newer technologies, or enhance customer experience? Determine the scope of the workshop. This includes the areas of the business to be addressed and the expected outcomes.
1. **Identify and invite stakeholders**: Identify key stakeholders based on the workshop's objectives. This includes business leaders, IT professionals, and end-users. Ensuring a diverse group will provide a comprehensive view of the organization's needs. Depending on the scope, you can target a specific department or the entire organization to gather a wide range of insights and perspectives.
1. **Invitation and communication**: Send out invitations well in advance, clearly stating the purpose, agenda, and expected outcomes of the workshop.
1. **Prepare workshop materials**: Provide participants with relevant background information, for example existing high-value Power Platform solutions in your organization. Prepare templates for brainstorming, prioritization, and documentation. Tools like whiteboards, sticky notes, and [Microsoft Whiteboard](/microsoft-365/whiteboard/) can facilitate the process.
1. **Select a facilitator**: Designate someone to lead and manage the workshop. This person will be responsible for explaining the rules, setting time limits, guiding participants through each stage, and facilitating discussions.

## Identify high-value use cases

First, identify use cases by asking workshop participants to prepare an elevator pitch of their idea. Depending on the number of attendees, you might want to split them into groups before this activity. The goal of the elvator pitch activity is to identify a specific problem within the organization that could be solved by a Power Platform solution and to develop a compelling pitch for the idea.

Prepare a template that prompts workshop particpants to:

1. **Name their idea**: Start by giving your idea a memorable name. This will help capture attention and make your pitch more engaging.
1. **Identify an important process**: Think about an important process within your organization. Explain what this process is and why it is important. This sets the context for your idea and highlights the significance of the problem you aim to solve.
1. **Highlight the challenges**: Consider the challenges associated with this process. Are there steps where human errors frequently occur? Are there inconsistencies that impact efficiency? Clearly outline these difficulties to emphasize the need for an autonomous solution.
1. **Envision the solution**: Imagine a Power Platform solution that could solve the challenging aspects of the process. Describe what the solution does and how it works. Does it use flows to automate error-prone processes? Does an app facilitate accessing data from anywhere? This section should provide a clear picture of the proposed solution.
1. **Explain the benefits**: Highlight the benefits of implementing the solution. Consider factors such as time saved, cost reductions, and improved accuracy. Additionally, think about other areas within your organization that might benefit from similar automation.

### Example pitch

To help you get started, here’s an example pitch based on the questionnaire:

1. **Idea name**: Smart Expense Tracker
1. **Important process**: Managing expense reports ensures that employees are reimbursed for business-related expenses and helps maintain accurate financial records. However, the current manual process is time-consuming and prone to errors.
1. **Challenges**:
   - **Manual data entry**: Employees must manually enter their expenses into spreadsheets, which often leads to errors and inconsistencies.
   - **Approval delays**: The approval process is slow, as managers need to review and approve each report individually.
   - **Lack of visibility**: Finance teams struggle to get real-time insights into expense data, making it difficult to manage budgets effectively.
1. **Solution**:
   - **Automated cloud flows**: The Smart Expense Tracker uses Power Automate to create cloud flows that automate the entire expense reporting process. Employees can submit their expenses through a user-friendly app, which automatically categorizes and validates the entries.
   - **Power App app**: The app provides a seamless interface for employees to upload receipts, and an AI Builder model extracts the relevant data which saves the employee from having to manually enter expense details. The app can also be used to track the status of their reports. Managers receive automated notifications for approvals, and finance teams can access real-time dashboards to monitor expenses.
1. **Benefits**:
   - **Time savings**: Automating the expense reporting process reduces the time employees spend on data entry and managers spend on approvals.
   - **Improved accuracy**: Automated validation checks minimize errors and inconsistencies in expense reports.
   - **Enhanced visibility**: Real-time dashboards provide finance teams with up-to-date insights into expense data, enabling better budget management.
   - **Scalability**: The solution can be easily scaled to other departments or processes, such as travel requests or procurement approvals, further enhancing organizational efficiency.

## Pitch use cases

Once workshop attendees have identified potential use cases, the next step is to have them pitch their ideas to the group and refine them through collaborative activities. Each attendee presents their use case, detailing the problem, proposed solution, and potential impact. The group provides feedback, asks questions, and suggests improvements. To ensure the best ideas move forward, attendees can vote on each other's ideas, and only the most voted ideas are taken to the next activity. This process not only helps in thoroughly vetting and developing the use cases but also promotes cross-education among team members, as they share their expertise and learn new skills from each other, ensuring the use cases are robust, feasible, and aligned with the workshop's overall goals.

## Refine use cases

Next, divide attendees into small groups. Each group will evaluate the pitched ideas based on stakeholders, objectives, challenges, and outcomes.

The goal of this activity is to

- Align on the most critical stakeholders and objectives.
- Identify and mitigate key challenges.
- Define success metrics through outcomes.

Prepare and distribute printouts of the example list of stakeholders, objectives, challenges, and outcomes.Ensure availability of markers, sticky notes, and templates for documenting discussions.

Groups pick items from the list and discuss the relevance of each item to the use case, considering the following categories:

- **Objectives**:
  - **Primary**: Objectives that are essential for the success of the use case.
  - **Secondary**: Objectives that are important but not critical.
- **Stakeholders**:
  - **Critical**: Stakeholders who have a significant impact on the success of the use case.
  - **Influential**: Stakeholders who can affect the use case but are not as critical.
- **Challenges**:
  - **High Impact**: Challenges that could significantly hinder the success of the use case.
  - **Manageable**: Challenges that can be addressed with relative ease.
- **Outcomes**:
  - **Essential**: Outcomes that are necessary for the success of the use case.
  - **Beneficial**: Outcomes that add value but are not essential.

Groups assign an importance level to each item based on their discussion and document the assigned importance levels and the rationale behind each decision.

The expected outcome of this activity is to gain a clear understanding of the most important stakeholders and objectives for the use case, to get awareness of key challenges and their potential impact, and to start defining concrete success metrics through well-defined outcomes, providing a clear path to measure the success of the proposed solutions.

To help you get started, here’s a list of sample stakeholders, objectives, challenges and outcomes. Refine this list based on your objectives, and make sure it's available to attendees - you could have it available as printouts on the day.
