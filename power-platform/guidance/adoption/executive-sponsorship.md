# Executive sponsorship

This article will help you consider how to get buy-in from an executive leader for your Power Platform adoption journey, learn about their role and activities, and how to identify an executive sponsor.

## Get buy-in from an executive sponsor

Citizen developers will come from all parts of your organization and will not traditionally sit in IT. As these people have *day jobs*, they will report to people who will need to buy in to the transformation you are bringing using Power Platform. You may need to empower people to take time from their *day jobs* to be involved in making apps, flows, and chatbots.

Consider how you will get executive buy-in, manager buy-in, and individual buy-in. An effective way to gain buy-in is to highlight the positive impact Power Platform could have for different stakeholders. For example, you might show an executive projections for cost reductions, a manager might be more motivated by the time that solution may save, and an individual may be excited by the learning opportunity.

Culture change can take time, and it is important to address people’s concerns and how it may impact their part of the organization both in the short term and the long term.

To gain buy-in from your leadership team, demonstrate the impact and [business value](business-value.md) of your Power Platform solutions, share other [customer success stories](https://aka.ms/powercatstories), or direct them to the [Total Economic Impact report of Microsoft Power Platform Premium capabilities](https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-forrester-tei-of-power-platform-premium-capabilities.html?lcid=en-us), conducted by Forrester, which outlines the time, cost, and productivity savings of Power Platform.

> Having an executive sponsor and executive leadership buy-in is one of the most important aspects for successful Power Platform adoption, especially in large organizations.

## Activities of an executive sponsor

Adopting Power Platform is far more than just a technology project. It's important to have executive support.

Although some successes can be achieved by a few motivated individuals, you will be in a better position when a senior leader is engaged, supportive, informed, and available to assist with activities such as:

- Formulating a strategic vision and priorities for Power Platform and low-code.
- Allocating staffing and prioritizing resources.
- Approving funding (for example, Power Apps per user licenses or AI Builder credits).
- Communicating announcements that are of critical importance.
- Decision-making.
- Resistance resolution (for issues that cannot be resolved by operational or tactical personnel).
- Supporting organizational changes (for example, creating or expanding the [Center of Excellence](coe.md)).

## Identifying an executive sponsor

There are multiple ways to identify an executive sponsor:

### Top-down

The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) may nominate the Chief Information Officer (CIO) or Head of Digital Transformation to advance the low-code adoption.

Having an executive sponsor at the C-level indicates that the organization recognizes the importance of Power Platform as a strategic asset.

### Bottom-up

An executive sponsor could emerge due to the success they've experienced with Power Platform. For example, a department within the organization, such as Marketing, has accomplished great business value with the use of Power Platform. A leader in that department may then grow into the executive sponsor role by sharing successes with other departments across the organization.

The challenge with this approach is that the sponsor does not have formal influence over other business units, and may experience challenges that are beyond their level of influence. Although initial successes can be achieved with a bottom-up approach, the recommendation is to seek a C-level sponsor.

## Maturity levels

The following maturity levels will help you assess the current state of your support strategy:

| Level | State of Power Platform support strategy |
| --- | --- |
| 100: Initial | No executive awareness of Power Platform and its part in the organization's digital transformation journey. |
| 200: Repeatable | Some executive awareness and support through informal channels. |
| 300: Defined | An executive sponsor is formally identified and expectations for this role are clear. |
| 400: Capable | An executive sponsor is well established, and a healthy relationship exists between the executive sponsor, CEO/CIO, business departments, and IT leadership. The teams share an understanding of what the organization wants to achieve with Power Platform, and is working towards that goal. |
| 500: Efficient | The executive sponsor is highly engaged and is a key driver for advancing Power Platform adoption. They take part in ongoing adoption improvements. KPIs (key performance indicators) or OKRs (objectives and key results) are used to track goals. They celebrate internal success stories and participate as sponsors in internal events such as [hackathons](hackathons.md). |
