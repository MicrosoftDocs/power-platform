# Report on resource usage

One of the key principles of administering Microsoft Power Platform is having full visibility into how your organization is using Power Apps and Power Automate. Insights into your adoption will help you govern and secure the platform, identify patterns, and nurture your makers to accelerate adoption.

In this section, you'll learn how to:

- Review out-of-the-box monitoring capabilities.
- Check service and environment health.
- Set alerts for security permissions or compliance regulations.
- Perform typical actions to ensure the security, health, and safety of the citizen developer environment.

Out-of-the-box tooling around monitoring, alerts, and actions falls into the following categories:

## What tools are available to monitor resource usage?

### Power Platform admin center

The [Power Platform admin center](/power-platform/admin/new-admin-center) is designed with an outcome-driven approach, where all functionality is intuitively organized in pages based on administrative tasks. This is typically considered the primary path for completing administrative activities. From a monitoring point of view, this channel is used mostly for ad-hoc interactive discovery.

- Use [tenant-level analytics](/power-platform/admin/tenant-level-analytics) to extract key service metrics based on user adoption across your environments.
- Use the [Monitor page](/power-platform/admin/monitoring/monitoring-overview) in the Power Platform admin center to understand solution health and detect degradations.
- Use the [Security page](/power-platform/admin/security/security-overview) to assess and monitor your security score and understand how to improve your security policies.
- Use the [Copilot page](/power-platform/admin/copilot/copilot-hub) to track usage, and access governance controls for Power Platform Copilots.
- Use [Power Platform Advisor](/power-platform/admin/power-platform-advisor) to monitor recommendations to optimize your tenant.
- Check the [Service health dashboard](/power-platform/admin/check-online-service-health) to view the status of the Power Platform service, details about existing service incidents, and up to 30 daysâ€™ worth of history.

### Microsoft Sentinel

[Detect threats to your organization](threat-detection.md) using [Microsoft Sentinel](/azure/sentinel/business-applications/solution-overview). Microsoft Sentinel equips admins with a comprehensive security and monitoring solution that intelligently detects and responds to suspicious activities such as mass data deletion or app execution from unauthorized geographies. You can also use threat detection rules to run regularly query the collected data and analyze it to discover threats.

### Custom tooling and extensibility

Power Platform administrators often have a need to orchestrate and automate routine activities for their tenants. These activities are often depend on the operational and governance requirements of the organization. The programmability and extensibility capabilities of the Power Platform empower administrators to create bespoke tools and solutions using a variety of resources.

- Create custom dashboards by using [Power Platform inventory and usage data](/power-platform/admin/build-custom-reports)
- Use [programmability and extensibility](/power-platform/admin/programmability-extensibility-overview) features - such as APIs, PowerShell cmdlets, the Power Platform CLI, and connectors - to manage and automate tasks. The Power Platform API provides a unified interface for managing tenant-level resources, while the Dataverse API allows for detailed data interactions within environments.
- Evaluate features of the [Center of Excellence Starter Kit](../coe/starter-kit.md), which offers a template implementation using the management and admin connectors and comes with a Power BI dashboard that can be used to gain tenant-wide insights.

This flexibility ensures that administrators can tailor their automation and orchestration efforts to the unique needs of their organization, enhancing efficiency and control over their Power Platform adoption.

## What should I monitor?

## Default environment

Every employee in an organization that uses the Power Platform has access to the default environment. As a Power Platform admin, you should consider, and when necessary, implement ways to control the default environment.

When monitoring the Default environment in Power Platform, it's crucial to keep an eye on several key aspects to ensure optimal governance and security:

- Track connector usage and identify which connectors are used. This can help inform your [Data Loss Prevention policy strategy](dlp-strategy.md).
- Discover apps and flows that have become widely adopted or business-critical. This can help inform which solutions may require more support or need to be moved to a dedicated environment.
- Discover unused and owner-less apps and flows. These may consume capacity and create clutter in the Default environment.

Learn more about [managing the Default environment](manage-default-environment.md).

## Power Automate usage

As an administrator, you should:

- Monitor usage and look for insights related to types of flows that are in use.
- Watch for errors by error type to look for common problems that might exist.
- Spot data usage that isn't expected by drilling in to connector usage and adjust your data loss prevention policies for that environment to ensure the overall health of the platform.

## Power Apps usage

As an administrator, you should:

- Watch overall adoption by monitoring insights into how much the apps are being used and when.
- Check out app launches in terms of being used in a browser or via a mobile player version and on which platforms. Following your device strategy, you could ensure users are using the latest player edition.
- Regularly monitor overall service performance to ensure user run-time experience when interacting with the platform services.

## Copilot Studio usage

As an administrator, you should:

- Watch overall adoption by monitoring insights into which Copilot features are used.
- Review govermance settings and adjust which environments have Copilot features turned on based on your requirements.
- Create training material to help your makers use AI responsibly.
