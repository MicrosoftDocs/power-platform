# Develop a Power Platform Adoption strategy

Power Platform delivers fundamental technology benefits that help your organization execute multiple business strategies. 

By using Power Platform, you can:

- Improve business agility
- Reduce costs
- Accelerate time to market
- Enhance productivity

To take advantage of this potential, start by documenting your Power Platform adoption vision in a way that addresses both business and technical stakeholders.

This approach helps you drive adoption efforts that capture targeted business value. The following steps help you document your adoption strategy efficiently:

1. [Assess your Adoption strategy](take-assessment.md). Take the Power Platform adoption assessment and use the results from the assessment to continue building your Power Platform Adoption strategy.
1. [Define vision, metrics, and goals](vision.md). Meet with your key stakeholders to document the objectives, the measurable key results, and the key initiatives behind Power Platform adoption.
1. [Measure and communicate business value](business-value.md). Define how to measure business value and align with your organization's objectives and key results (OKRs).
1. [Get Executive sponsorship](executive-sponsorship.md). Secure an executive sponsor and get leadership buy-in.
1. [Establish a Center of Excellence](coe.md). Maximize the platformâ€™s potential and ensure its sustainable, scalable, and secure use across the enterprise.
