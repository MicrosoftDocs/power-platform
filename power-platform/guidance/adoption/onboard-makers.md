# Onboard new community members and makers

Effective onboarding integrates new Power Platform makers into your community. A well-structured onboarding process not only boosts engagement but also sets the stage for long-term success. In this article, we explore the key components of a streamlined onboarding journey and how to guide new members from passive participants to active contributors.

## Laying the foundations for a streamlined onboarding journey

1. **Build momentum**: Quickly integrating new members into the community is essential for maintaining their initial enthusiasm. Providing immediate access to resources, introductory sessions, and quick wins can help new makers feel valued and motivated to engage further.
1. **Reduce turnover**: A streamlined onboarding process reduces the likelihood of new members feeling overwhelmed or disconnected. By offering clear guidance and support, you can ensure that new makers feel confident and capable, decreasing the chances of early dropout.
1. **Cultivate culture**: Instilling the community's values and practices from the start helps new members align with the community's ethos. This cultural integration fosters a sense of belonging and encourages adherence to community norms and standards.
1. **Clarify communication channels**: Clear communication helps new members understand where, when, and how to get help. Providing a roadmap of communication channels and resources ensures that new makers can easily navigate the community and access support when needed.

## The maker journey

The goal is to guide community members from being passive participants to becoming engaged and happy contributors. Some members might progress to influencing community initiatives or joining the community team, while others might remain less active. The key is to ensure that the onboarding process equips all members with the tools and support they need to achieve their desired level of involvement and satisfaction within the community.

1. **Novice navigator**: At this stage, new members are exploring the community and familiarizing themselves with the basics of Power Platform. Providing introductory resources and mentorship can help them gain confidence and knowledge.
1. **Engaged explorer**: As members become more comfortable, they start to engage more actively, seeking out learning opportunities and participating in discussions. Encouraging this engagement through interactive content and community events is key.
1. **Active contributor**: Members at this stage begin to contribute their knowledge and skills to the community. Recognizing and celebrating their contributions can motivate them to continue sharing and collaborating.
1. **Community builder**: These members take on more significant roles, such as organizing events or leading projects. Providing leadership opportunities and support can help them grow and inspire others.
1. **Influential leader**: At the highest level, members influence community initiatives and might become part of the community team. Empowering these leaders to drive change and mentor others ensures the community's ongoing growth and success.

By laying the foundations for a streamlined onboarding journey, you can guide new Power Platform makers through these stages, helping them become happy, engaged, and influential members of your community.

## Develop an onboarding process

Let's now explore a comprehensive six-week onboarding process designed to effectively integrate new Power Platform makers into the community. This structured approach ensures that new members receive the support and resources they need to become active and engaged participants. By breaking down the onboarding journey into weekly activities, we can provide a clear roadmap that guides new makers from their initial introduction to becoming valuable contributors.

Highlighting these experiences can inspire new members and demonstrate the value of active participation.
