# Onboard new community members and makers

Effective onboarding integrates new Power Platform makers into your community. A well-structured onboarding process not only boosts engagement but also sets the stage for long-term success. This article explores the key components of a streamlined onboarding journey and describes how to guide new members from passive participants to active contributors.

## Lay the foundations for a streamlined onboarding journey

A streamlined onboarding journey is essential for new Power Platform makers to feel welcomed and engaged in the community. 

- **Build momentum**: Quickly integrate new members into the community to maintain their initial enthusiasm. Provide immediate access to resources, introductory sessions, and quick wins to help new makers feel valued and motivated to engage further.
- **Reduce turnover**: Use a streamlined onboarding process to reduce the likelihood of new members feeling overwhelmed or disconnected. By offering clear guidance and support, you ensure that new makers feel confident and capable, decreasing the chances of early dropout.
- **Cultivate culture**: Instill the community's values and practices from the start to help new members align with the community's ethos. This cultural integration fosters a sense of belonging and encourages adherence to community norms and standards.
- **Clarify communication channels**: Use clear communication to help new members understand where, when, and how to get help. Provide a roadmap of communication channels and resources to ensure new makers can easily navigate the community and access support when needed.

### The maker journey

The goal is to guide community members from passive participants to engaged and happy contributors. Some members may progress to influencing community initiatives, join the community team, or remain less active. The key is to ensure that the onboarding process equips all members with the tools and support they need to achieve their desired level of involvement and satisfaction within the community.

- **Novice navigator**: At this stage, new members are exploring the community and familiarizing themselves with the basics of Power Platform. Provide introductory resources and mentorship to help them gain confidence and knowledge.
- **Engaged explorer**: As members become more comfortable, they start to engage more actively, seeking out learning opportunities and participating in discussions. Encourage this engagement through interactive content and community events.
- **Active contributor**: Members at this stage begin to contribute their knowledge and skills to the community. Recognize and celebrate their contributions to motivate them to continue sharing and collaborating.
- **Community builder**: These members take on more significant roles like organizing events or leading projects. Provide leadership opportunities and support to help them grow and inspire others.
- **Influential leader**: At the highest level, members influence community initiatives and might join the community team. Empower these leaders to drive change and mentor others to ensure the community's ongoing growth and success.

Laying the foundations for a streamlined onboarding journey guides new Power Platform makers through these stages, helping them become happy, engaged, and influential community members.

## Develop an onboarding process

Let's now explore a comprehensive six-week onboarding process designed to effectively integrate new Power Platform makers into the community. This structured approach ensures that new members receive the support and resources they need to become active and engaged participants. By breaking the onboarding journey into weekly activities, this process provides a clear roadmap to guide new makers from their initial introduction to becoming valuable contributors. 

### Week 1: Welcome and introduction

Let's begin by examining the activities planned for the first week of the onboarding process. This week focuses on welcoming new members and providing them with essential information to help them get started.

- **Day one: Welcome message**: New members receive a personalized welcome message from the community team. This message includes a brief introduction to the community's purpose, culture, and key resources. The goal is to make new members feel valued and informed from the start.

- **Day three: Getting started guide**: On the third day, new members receive a "Getting Started" guide. This guide provides essential information on how to navigate the community platform, participate in discussions, and access available resources. It serves as a practical tool to help new members quickly become familiar with the community's environment.

- **Day five: Invitation to introductory webinar**: New members are invited to a live introductory webinar. This session gives them an opportunity to learn more about the community, ask questions, and connect with other members. The webinar is designed to provide a comprehensive overview and foster initial engagement.

### Week 2: Engagement and education

In the second week of the onboarding process, the focus shifts to engaging new members and providing educational opportunities to deepen their understanding of Power Platform.

- **Day one: Bi-weekly webinar**: New members are invited to join a bi-weekly webinar that walks them through the communityâ€™s key features. This session introduces the community team and explains the benefits of being a member. The webinar aims to provide a comprehensive overview and foster a sense of belonging and connection.

- **Day three: Interactive Q&A session**: On the third day, an informal bi-weekly drop-in session is hosted where members can ask questions and receive real-time responses. This interactive Q&A session allows new members to clarify any doubts, seek guidance, and engage directly with the community team and other members.

### Week 3: Deep-dive into community culture

In the third week of the onboarding process, the focus is on immersing new members in the community culture and fostering connections.

- **Day one: Share a success story**: Share a success story from the community. This story should showcase how a member has effectively used Power Platform to achieve significant results. Highlighting success stories not only inspires new members but also demonstrates the tangible benefits of active participation in the community.

- **Mid-week: Peer introduction**: Mid-week, facilitate introductions into the community mentor program. This program pairs new members with experienced mentors who guide them through their journey. Peer introductions help new members build relationships, gain insights, and feel more connected to the community.

### Week 4: Involvement and contribution

In the fourth week of the onboarding process, the focus is on encouraging new members to actively contribute and get involved in the community.

- **Start of week: Call for contributions**: At the beginning of the week, encourage new members to contribute to discussions or share their own experiences. This call for contributions helps new members feel valued and gives them an opportunity to actively participate in the community.

- **Mid-week: Feature new member contributions**: Mid-week, feature the contributions of new members. Showcase their posts, projects, or insights. Highlighting new member contributions not only recognizes their efforts but also motivates others to participate and share their experiences.

### Week 5: Feedback and support

In the fifth week of the onboarding process, the focus is on gathering feedback from new members and providing more support to ensure their continued engagement. 

- **Start of week: Personalized check-in**: At the beginning of the week, send personalized messages to each new member asking for feedback on their experience so far. This check-in helps identify any challenges they might be facing and provides an opportunity to address their needs and concerns.

- **Mid-week: Feature member stories**: Mid-week, share stories, or testimonials from members about what they've gained from the community. Highlighting these experiences can inspire new members and demonstrate the value of active participation. It also fosters a sense of community by showcasing the diverse benefits that members have experienced.

### Week 6: Integration and ongoing engagement

In the sixth and final week of the onboarding process, the focus is on integrating new members into ongoing community activities and ensuring their continued engagement. 

- **Start of week: Invitation to community projects**: At the beginning of the week, invite new members to participate in a community project or challenge. This opportunity encourages them to apply their skills, collaborate with others, and contribute to meaningful community initiatives.

- **Mid-week: Feature new member contributions**: Mid-week, publicly recognize new members who are actively participating and contributing. Highlighting their efforts not only acknowledges their contributions but also encourages continued engagement and inspires other members to get involved.

By incorporating these activities, new Power Platform makers feel fully integrated into the community and motivated to continue their journey. This approach ensures that they remain engaged, contributing members who are well-supported and connected within the community.
