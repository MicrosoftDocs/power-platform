# Support strategy - Maturity levels

The following maturity levels will help you assess the current state of your support strategy:

| **Level** | **State of Power Platform support strategy** |
| --- | --- |
| 100: Initial | <ul><li>Makers support their own apps and flows.</li><li>No or limited rules on how apps and flows should be supported by IT and Business stakeholders.</li><li>The help desk isn't aware and not prepared to handle Power Platform queries.</li><li>Individual business units find ways of supporting each other, which happens in silos and isn't consistent across the organization. Makers in different business units will receive different support based on the maturity of their department.</li></ul> |
| 200: Repeatable | <ul><li>Community support is getting established, often driven by individual Power Platform technical experts who are passionate about Power Platform. They're working on bringing together and connecting makers to establish a support network.</li><li>An internal discussion channel is available, and becomes a place for Q&A. This channel may be growing organically, and new makers discover it through word of mouth rather than by being automatically invited to it. The Center of Excellence (CoE) has little oversight of the channel. </li><li>There's some degree of commitment and governance measures to manage solution lifecycle stages, which often depends on the individual maker and their knowledge. They learned best practices themselves.</li><li>The help desk handles a few of the most common technical support issues. |
| 300: Defined | <ul><li>Support strategy involves help desk. The help desk is prepared to handle all known and expected Power Platform technical support issues, and the CoE provides appropriate extended support when required.</li><li>Defined risk profile dictates the level of support a solution will receive (for example, IT supported, IT blessed, Maker supported). Makers are quickly able to assess the risk profile of their solution through a decision matrix and are able to identify what next steps to take â€“ for example, get test/prod environments, hand over solution, knowledge transfer to support team. Often this work is reactive, after the solution has been built, meaning IT doesn't have advance visibility.</li><li>The internal discussion channel is now popular and largely self-sustaining. CoE members actively monitor and manage the discussion channel to ensure questions are answered quickly and correctly.</li></ul>|
| 400: Capable | <ul><li>Dedicated Support team.</li><li>Continuous improvement plans in line with business strategy.</li><li>Clearly understood roles and responsibilities.</li><li>SLAs are in place to define help desk support expectations, including extended support, and they're clear to everyone involved. </li></ul>|
| 500: Efficient | <ul><li>Automation of support activities (for example, change ownership, bot for FAQs). </li><li>Responsibilities and ownership to build and operate solutions are fully understood. </li><li>Bidirectional feedback loops exist between the help desk and the CoE.</li><li>Key performance indicators measure community engagement and satisfaction.</li><li>Automation is in place when it adds direct value to the user experience (for example, automatic access to the community), or for specific help desk activities (for example, use of APIs and scripts that increase speed and reduce error). </li></ul>|
