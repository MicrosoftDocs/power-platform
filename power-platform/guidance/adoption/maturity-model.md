# Power Platform adoption maturity model- Repeatable patterns for successful Power Platform adoption

Microsoft Power Platformâ€™s low-code approach to solution delivery allows thousands of organizations worldwide use technology to transform their business. It allows more people create applications and use mobile platforms and artificial intelligence to introduce new ways of working.

This transformation is more critical than ever. Technology disrupts every industry, but it's also key to those that thrive. It's important to start the digital transformation journey incrementally and with urgency. Adopting a technology as broadly applicable as Microsoft Power Platform is a transition for any organization.

Consistent themes, patterns, practices, and behaviors underpin the progress of successful organizations implementing comprehensive digital transformation with Power Platform. The result of this work is the Power Platform adoption maturity model, which has broken down this process into five stages, based on the [Capability Maturity Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model).

> [!NOTE]
> Organizational adoption maturity is a long journey. It takes time, effort, and planning to progress to the higher levels.
