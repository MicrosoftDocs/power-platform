# Power Platform adoption maturity model: Repeatable patterns for successful adoption

Microsoft Power Platform's low-code approach to solution delivery empowers thousands of organizations worldwide to transform their business. It enables more people to create applications and to use mobile platforms and artificial intelligence, which has transformed organizations by introducing new and more efficient ways of working.

This transformation is more critical than ever. Technology is disrupting every industry, but it also drives success for thriving organizations. It's essential to begin the digital transformation journey incrementally, yet with urgency. Adopting a versatile technology like Microsoft Power Platform represents a significant transition for any organization.

Organizational adoption maturity is a long journey. It takes time, effort, and planning to progress. Consistent themes, patterns, practices, and behaviors drive the success of organizations implementing comprehensive digital transformation with Power Platform. These common elements are reflected in the Power Platform adoption maturity model, a framework designed to help organizations progress from ad hoc processes to well-defined, optimized, and continuously improving practices. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Power Platform maturity model is based on the Capability Maturity Model (CMM), a development model widely used in software development, IT, and other industries to assess and enhance organizational maturity. Another such model is [Microsoft's Platform Engineering Capability Model](/platform-engineering/platform-engineering-capability-model), designed to improve platform engineering practices.
