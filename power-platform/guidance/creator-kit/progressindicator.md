## Description

Progress indicators are used to show the completion status of an operation lasting more than two seconds. If the state of progress can't be determined, use a [Spinner](spinner.md) or use the `Indeterminate Indicator` type instead. Progress indicators can appear in a new panel, in a flyout window, under the UI that initiated the operation, or they can even replace the initiating UI as long as the UI can return if you cancel or stop the activity.

This code component provides a wrapper around the [Fluent UI ProgressIndicator](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/progressindicator) control for use in canvas & custom pages. See component documentation for best practices.

## Properties

### Key properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Label` | Optional label for spinner. |
| `Percentage Complete` | Percentage of the operation completed, on the scale of 0 to 1. If not set Indeterminate Indicator will be shown. |
| `TypeOfIndicator` | Specifies the type of indicator style. Choices: `Default Indicator` or `IndeterminateIndicator` |
| `HideProgressState` |  Specify true to hide progress state |
| `BarHeight` |  Specify height of the bar as applicable |

### Style properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Theme` | Accepts a JSON string that is generated using [Fluent UI Theme Designer (windows.net)](https://fabricweb.z5.web.core.windows.net/pr-deploy-site/refs/heads/master/theming-designer/). Leaving this blank will use the default theme defined by Power Apps. See [theming](theme.md) for guidance on how to configure. |
| `AccessibilityLabel` | Screen reader aria-label |

## Behavior

### Display loading progress

Make the `ProgressIndicator` control itself (or the surface it's located within) visible when a process begins, then update a variable with the value as segments of the process are completed. Hide it when the process is complete. Use a variable to control the visibility of the control, and update the values between the major code blocks of the process that need to be indicated.

```powerapps-dot
UpdateContext({ var_showProgress: true , var_progressValue: 0 });

/* Some code ... */

UpdateContext({ var_progressValue: 25 });

/* Some code ... */

UpdateContext({ var_progressValue: 50 });

/* Some code ... */

UpdateContext({ var_progressValue: 75 });

/* Some code ... */

UpdateContext({ var_progressValue: 100 });

Notify("Successfully completed process", NotificationType.Success);

UpdateContext({ var_showProgress: false });

```

Provide the `var_showProgress` variable as the value for the `Visible` property of the `ProgressIndicator` (or the surface containing it), and assign the `var_progressValue` variable for the `Value` property.


## Limitations

This canvas component can only be used in canvas apps and custom pages.
