## Description

Expand menus are like `Nav` components used to provide navigation, which consists of links to the main areas of an app or site. You can also expand and collapse the menu, which gives the user an option for more space if they want it. The ExpandMenu control should be used with layout containers to make sure the experience is responsive due to its nature of varying width when the app is played.

This canvas component mimics the style and *limited* behavior of the [Fluent UI Nav control](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/controls/web/Nav).

## Properties

### Key properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Items` | A dataset that displays items in the menu. |
| `IsNavigationEnabled` | Enable to navigate to the item's specified `Screen` on select |
| `DefaultExpandValue` | Whether the control is expanded on load |


### :::no-loc text="Items"::: properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Label` | The text to display in the menu item. |
| `Icon` | [Fluent UI Icon](https://uifabricicons.azurewebsites.net/) by name |
| `Screen` | App screen that the item will navigate to when selected. |

Example `Items` property:

```powerapps-dot
Table(
    {
        Icon: "PowerApps", 
        Label: "Power Apps", 
        Screen:PowerAppsScreen
    },{
        Icon: "PowerBILogo", 
        Label: "Power BI", 
        Screen:PowerBIScreen
    },{
        Icon: "PowerAutomateLogo", 
        Label: "Power Automate", 
        Screen:PowerAutomateScreen
    },{
        Icon: "Dataverse", 
        Label: "Dataverse", 
        Screen:DataverseScreen
    }
)
```

### Style properties

| Property | Description |

| `Theme` | The Theme object. See [theming](theme.md) for guidance on how to configure. |

### Event properties

| Property | Description |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The screen values in the preceding example code are from a sample, and might not exist in your app. Ensure that you replace the screen values with screen names in your app, as appropriate.

## Behavior

### Expand and collapse

Set the `Width` property to the following expression. The width values can be adjusted based on the resolution of the app.

```powerapps-dot
If( Self.IsExpanded, 200, 46 )
```

## Limitations

This canvas component can only be used in canvas apps and custom pages.
