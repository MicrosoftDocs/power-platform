# :::no-loc text="Breadcrumb"::: control

A control used to provide navigation.

## Description

`Breadcrumb` controls should be used as a navigational aid in your app or site. They indicate the current page's location within a hierarchy and help the user understand where they are in relation to the rest of that hierarchy. A breadcrumb also provides one-click access to higher levels of that hierarchy.

This code component provides a wrapper around the [Fluent UI Breadcrumb](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/controls/web/breadcrumb) control for use in canvas apps and custom pages. 


## Properties
### Key properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `SelectedKey ` | This denotes the key selected. This will be updated via the OnChange event when the user interacts with the control. |
| `Items` | The action items to render |

#### `Items` properties

Each item uses the following schema to visualize data in the component. 

| Name | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `ItemDisplayName` | The Display Name of the breadcrumb item |
| `ItemKey` | The key to use to indicate which item is selected, and when adding sub items. The keys must be unique. |
| `ItemClickable` | Set to false incase the specific breadcrumb item be non-clickable. |

Example Power Fx formula:

  ```powerapps-dot
  Table(
      {
          ItemKey: "1",
          ItemDisplayName: "General",
          ItemClickable: true
      },
      {
          ItemKey: "2",
          ItemDisplayName: "Document",
          ItemClickable: true
      }
  )
  ```

### Style properties

| Name | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `Theme ` | Accepts a JSON string that is generated using [Fluent UI Theme Designer (windows.net)](https://fabricweb.z5.web.core.windows.net/pr-deploy-site/refs/heads/master/theming-designer/). Leaving this blank will use the default theme defined by Power Apps. See [theming](theme.md) for guidance on how to configure. |
| `AccessibilityLabel` | Screen reader aria-label |
| `MaxDisplayedItems` | The maximum number of breadcrumbs to display before coalescing. If zero, then all breadcrumbs will be rendered. |
| `OverflowIndex` | Optional index where overflow items will be collapsed. By default it is set to zero. |

### Event properties
| Name | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| `InputEvent ` | An event to send to the control. E.g. `SetFocus`. See below. |

## Behavior

Supports [SetFocus](setfocus.md) as an `InputEvent`.

### Configure "On Select" behavior

Use the [**Switch()**](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-if) formula in the component's `OnSelect` property to configure specific actions for each item by referring to the control's selected `ItemKey` as the switch value.

Replace the `false` values with appropriate expressions in the Power Fx language. 

Because this control is used for navigation, a logical action is to use [navigation functions](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-navigate) (ideally to a relevant screen with the related data loaded).

  ```powerapps-dot
    Switch( Self.Selected.ItemKey,
      /* Action for ItemKey 1 */
      "1", false,
      
      /* Action for ItemKey 2 */
      "2", false,
    
      /* Default action */
          false
    )
  ```
### Setting focus on the control
When a new dialog is shown, and the default focus should be on the control, an explicit set focus will be needed.

To make calls to the input event, you can set a context variable that is bound to the Input Event property to a string that starts with `SetFocus` and followed by a random element to ensure that the app detects it as a change.

Example Power Fx formula:
```powerapps-dot
UpdateContext({ ctxResizableTextareaEvent:"SetFocus" & Text(Rand()) }));
```

The context variable `ctxResizableTextareaEvent` would then be bound to the property Input Event property.

## Limitations

This code component can only be used in canvas apps and custom pages.
