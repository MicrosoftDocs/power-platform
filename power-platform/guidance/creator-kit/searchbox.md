## Description

A search box (`SearchBox`) provides an input field for searching within a site or app to find specific items.

This code component provides a wrapper around the [Fluent UI SearchBox](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/searchbox) control for use in canvas & custom pages.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE[cc_preview_features_definition](../../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]

## Key properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `SearchText` | Text that is input by the user. Refer to this as the input for search functions. |
| `IconName` | Name of the Fluent UI icon (see [Fluent UI Icons](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/styles/web/icons)). |
| `Underlined` | Whether or not the SearchBox is underlined. |
| `DisableAnimation` | Whether or not to animate the SearchBox icon on focus. |
| `PlaceholderText` | Placeholder for the search box. |

### Additional properties

| Property | Description |

| `AccessibilityLabel` | Screen reader aria-label. |
| `InputEvent` | An event to send to the control. E.g. `SetFocus`. |

## Example

### Configure search behavior

Add this control to your app where a search interface is needed, usually coupled with a gallery, [`DetailsList`](detailslist.md), or any control that can display a dataset.

Create a search experience by using the [Search() or Filter()](/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/functions/function-filter-lookup) expressions that use the value of the `SearchText` property in the `SearchBox`.

```powerapps-dot
Search( Accounts, SearchBox.SearchText, "name" )
```

## Limitations

This code component can only be used in canvas apps and custom pages.
