## Description

This code component provides a wrapper around the [Fluent UI Calendar](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/calendar) control bound to a button for use in canvas & custom pages.

## Properties
### Key properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `SelectedDateValue` | The date value to be pre-selected or Selected after on change event. For e.g. : Today's Date: `Today()`, Date based on language: `DateValue("24/7/2022",Language())`,  specific regional language: `DateValue("24/07/2022","en-GB")`|
| `ShowGoToToday` | Whether the 'Go to Today' option is visible |
| `MonthPickerVisible` | Whether the month picker is visible  |
| `DayPickerVisible` | Whether the day picker is visible |
| `HighlightSelectedMonth` | Whether the selected month is  highlighted in the calendar |
| `HighlightCurrentMonth` | Whether the current month is highlighted in the calendar |
| `ShowWeekNumbers` | Whether the week numbers are visible |
| `ShowSixWeeksByDefault` | Whether the sixth week is visible by default. |
| `MinDate` | If specified a date value, navigation beyond that date will not be allowed. For correct format, refer to the example provided for Selected Date. |
| `MaxDate` | If specified a date value, navigation beyond that date will not be allowed. For correct format, refer to the example provided for Selected Date. |
| `FirstDayOfWeek` | Select the day to be displayed as first day of week in calendar. |

### Style Properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Theme` | Accepts a JSON string that is generated using [Fluent UI Theme Designer (windows.net)](https://fabricweb.z5.web.core.windows.net/pr-deploy-site/refs/heads/master/theming-designer/). Leaving this blank will use the default theme defined by Power Apps. See [theming](theme.md) for guidance on how to configure. |
| `BackgroundColor` | Background color for the component. e.g. White or #ffffff |
| `AccessibilityLabel` | Screen reader aria-label |


### Event Properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `InputEvent` | An event to send to the control. E.g. `SetFocus`. See below. |

## Behavior 

Supports [SetFocus](setfocus.md) as an `InputEvent`.

### Using OnChange

When a date is selected, value can be obtained by the selectedDate output property. Below is a set of sample code which can be added in 'OnChange' property, depending on how to output need to be visualized.

```
Set(var_SelectedDate, If(!IsBlank(Self.selectedDateValue), Text(Self.selectedDateValue, ShortDate, Language())));
// Example - Output: 7/14/2022
```

```
Set(var_SelectedDate, If(!IsBlank(Self.selectedDateValue), Text(Self.selectedDateValue, LongDate, Language())));
// Example - Output: Sunday, July 3, 2022

```

```
Set(var_SelectedDate, If(!IsBlank(Self.selectedDateValue), Text(Self.selectedDateValue, ShortDate, "en-GB")));
// Example - Output: 14/07/2022
```

### Setting Focus on the control

When a new dialog is shown, and the default focus should be on the control, an explicit set focus will be needed.

To make calls to the input event, you can set a context variable that is bound to the Input Event property to a string that starts with `SetFocus` and followed by a random element to ensure that the app detects it as a change.

Example Power Fx formula:

```vb
UpdateContext({ctxResizableTextareaEvent:"SetFocus" & Text(Rand())}));
```

The context variable `ctxResizableTextareaEvent` would then be bound to the property `InputEvent` property.

## Limitations

This code component can only be used in canvas apps and custom pages.
