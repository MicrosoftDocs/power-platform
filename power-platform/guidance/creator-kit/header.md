## Description

A `Header` is commonly used to display global app details (e.g., app name or page name) and  navigation actions (e.g., navigation to home or back buttons).

The `Header` component can replace the default Power Apps header if you want different look or behavior.

The control should be used with layout containers to make sure the experience is responsive due to its nature of varying width when the app is played.

This canvas component mimics the style and behavior of the default Power Apps header, and can actually replace it (see Behavior section below).

## Behavior

### Replace default Power Apps navigation bar with `Header`

*\*Only applies to canvas apps\**

If you want to only display the header, you can hide the default navigation bar that is rendered by Power Apps player by sharing the app link with the query parameter `hideNavBar`:

```powerapps-dot
https://apps.powerapps.com/play/APPID?source=iframe&hidenavbar=true
```

Where `APPID` is replaced with your app's value. Note that the parameters are required for it to render without the default navigation bar. Canvas apps that are played without the query parameters, such as directly from the maker portal, will still render the default bar.

## Limitations

This canvas component can only be used in canvas apps. It can be used in custom pages, but is likely not needed as pages are embedded in model driven apps.
