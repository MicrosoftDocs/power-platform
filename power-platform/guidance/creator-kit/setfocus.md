# Set Focus on a control

When a new dialog is shown, and the default focus should be on the control, an explicit set focus will be needed. 

To make calls to the input event, you can set a context variable that is bound to the Input Event property to a string that starts with `SetFocus` and followed by a random element to ensure that the app detects it as a change.

Example Power Fx formula that triggers the focus behavior:

```powerapps-dot
UpdateContext({ ctxComponentEvent: "SetFocus" & Text(Rand()) });
```

The component's `InputEvent` property would then be bound to the context variable `ctxComponentEvent`.

> [!NOTE]
> `Text(Rand())` is used to generate a unique value for the `ctxComponentEvent`. A unique value change is required to trigger an event in the component.
