## Description

The people picker (`PeoplePicker`) is used to select one or more entities, such as people or groups, from a list. It makes composing an email to someone, or adding them to a group, easy if you donâ€™t know their full name or email address.

## Examples

`PeoplePicker` supports other sources from where the input collection can be retrieved. Following are the examples on how to use the `PeoplePicker` component.

### Office 365 Users Connector

1. Add the Office 365 Users connector as a data source.

1. Assign the below Power Fx formula to the **On Search** property of the control to create a collection called `UserCollection`.

    ```powerapps-dot
    ClearCollect(
        UserCollection,
        AddColumns(
            Filter(
                Office365Users.SearchUser(
                    {
                        searchTerm: Self.SearchText,
                        top: 500
                    }
                ),
                !(Mail in Self.SelectedPeople.PersonaKey)
            ),
            "SuggestionImgUrl",
            Substitute(
                JSON(
                    Office365Users.UserPhotoV2(Id),
                    JSONFormat.IncludeBinaryData
                ),
                """",
                ""
            ),
            "SuggestionKey",
            Mail,
            "SuggestionName",
            DisplayName,
            "SuggestionRole",
            JobTitle,
            "SuggestionPresence",
            "away"
        )
    )
    ```

1. Set the `Suggestions_Items` property to `UserCollection`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The above formula includes a consecutive request to get UserPhoto, which increases loading time. If you do not need photos and want to decrease search time, use the following formula in the `Suggestions_Items` property of the control instead of `UserCollection`: <br> 
    ```
    AddColumns(
        Office365Users.SearchUser({ searchTerm: Self.SearchText, top: 500 }),
        "SuggestionKey", Mail, 
        "SuggestionName", DisplayName,
        "SuggestionRole", JobTitle
    )
    ```

At this point the control is functioning and selected members can be obtained from the `SelectedPeople` property.

```powerapps-dot
PeoplePicker1.SelectedPeople
```

### With Dataverse tables - Microsoft Entra Users or Users

1. Set up the `Suggestions_Items` Property by specifying the below code snippet.

      Add Users or specific users(using below code) from table to the items collection(under `Suggestions_Items` property) of `PeoplePicker`.

    -**`AAD Users` table**
      ```powerapps-dot
      Search('AAD Users', Self.SearchText,"displayname" ,"mail")
      ```
   -**`Users` table**
      ```powerapps-dot
      Search('Users', Self.SearchText,"fullname","internalemailaddress")
      ```

1. Map the columns according to your need using AddColumns(). Below is an example of Column-Property Mapping:

    |Property Name|AADUser Table Column|User Table Column|
    |-------------|--------------------|-----------------|
    |SuggestionKey|"mail"|"internalemailaddress"|
    |SuggestionName|"displayname"|"fullname"|
    |SuggestionRole|"jobtitle"|"jobtitle"|

At this point, the people picker should be working and the selected members can be obtained from SelectedPeople Property.

```powerapps-dot
PeoplePicker1.SelectedPeople
```
