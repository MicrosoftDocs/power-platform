## Description

Pickers are used to select one or more items, such as tags or files, from a large list.

Picker code components allow the [Fluent UI picker menu components](https://developer.microsoft.com/fluentui#/controls/web/Pickers) to be used from inside canvas apps and custom pages.

The Tag Picker code component provides the following features:

1. Binds to an input collection for the chosen tags.
1. Binds to an input collection for suggested tags.
1. Allows users to select from suggestions or enter a free-text tag.
1. Raises an **On Change** event when a user adds or removes a tag.
1. Allows programmatic **Set Focus**.

### Datasets

The Tag Picker has the following input datasets, which are described in detail in [Key properties](#key-properties) later in this article.

- `Tags` 
  - `TagsDisplayName` 
- `Suggestions` 
  - `SuggestionsDisplayName` 
  - `SuggestionSubDisplayName`

The `Suggestions` dataset should be filtered by using the `SearchTerm` output property, for example:

```powerapps-dot
Search(colSuggestions,TagPicker.SearchTerm,"name")
```

## Properties

### Key properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Items` | A collection (table) of tags. The app is responsible for adding or removing tags in response to the component's raising Add or Remove events (described in the following [OnChange event section](#onchange-event)). |
| `Suggestions_Items` | A collection (table) of suggestions. |
| `TagMaxWidth` | The maximum width of the tags when rendering. Overflow text will be truncated with ellipsis's and a hover tooltip shows the full text. |
| `AllowFreeText` | When typing a value, do not not automatically select the first suggestion so that a free text entry can be provided rather than selecting from a pre-defined list. |
| `SearchTermToShortMessage` | The message to display when the Search Term is less than the `MinimumSearchTermLength`.
| `HintText` | The message to display inside the Picker when no search term is provided. |
| `NoSuggestionsFoundMessage` | The message to display when the Suggestions collection contains no results. |
| `MinimumSearchTermLength` | The minimum number of character to trigger the suggestions flyout. |
| `MaxTags` | The maximum number of tags that can be added. After this number, the Tag Picker will be re-only until a tag is removed. |
| `Error` | True when the red error border should be displayed. |

### `Items` properties
| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `TagsDisplayName` | Set to the name of the column that holds the tag display name. |

### `Suggestions` properties
| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `SuggestionsDisplayName` | set to the name of the column that holds the suggestion display name. |
| `SuggestionsSubDisplayName` | (Optional) set to the name of the column that holds the secondary line of text. |

### Style properties
| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Theme` | Accepts a JSON string that is generated using [Fluent UI Theme Designer (windows.net)](https://fabricweb.z5.web.core.windows.net/pr-deploy-site/refs/heads/master/theming-designer/). Leaving this blank will use the default theme defined by Power Apps. See [theming](theme.md) for guidance on how to configure. |
| `FontSize` | the font size of the tags shown inside the Picker. |
| `BorderRadius` | the border radius of the tags shown inside the Picker. |
| `ItemHeight` | the height of the tags (pixesl) shown inside the Picker. |
| `AccessibilityLabel` | Screen reader aria-label |

### Event properties
| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `Input Event` | Set to the event to sent to the `TagPicker` |

### Output properties
| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `SearchTerm` | The text entered into the Tag Picker that can be used for filtering the suggestions dataset. |
| `TagsDisplayName` | the text that is used to create a new **Tag** when the **On Change** event is fired |
| `AutoHeight` | When the tag picker wraps onto multiple lines, the **Auto Height** property can be used to control the height of a responsive container height. |

## Behavior

Supports [SetFocus](setfocus.md) as an `InputEvent`.

### OnChange event

The `TagPicker`component raises an `OnChange` event when tags are added or removed. The properties used are:

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `TagEvent` | The name of the event raised |
| `TagKey` | The key of the item that has raised the event (if the event is related to a tag) |

The event should contain an expression similar to:

```powerapps-dot
If( TagPicker.TagEvent = "Add" && CountRows(Filter(colTags,name=TagPicker.TagsDisplayName)) = 0,
    Collect( colTags, { name:TagPicker.TagsDisplayName })
);

If( TagPicker.TagEvent="Remove",
 RemoveIf( colTags,name=Text(TagPicker.TagsDisplayName) )
);
```

## Limitations

This code component can only be used in canvas apps and custom pages.
