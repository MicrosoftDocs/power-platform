# CoE CLI development adding a new command (Deprecated)

> [!NOTE]
> The CoE CLI is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Use the [Power Platform Project Setup Wizard](../../../alm-accelerator/setup-admin-tasks.md) to set up and manage your ALM Accelerator for Power Platform projects.

To add a new sample command, you can use the following command to template the initial setup of the TypeScript command and the Jest JavaScript testing framework unit test.

```bash
cd coe-cli
coe cli add -n sample
```

## Connecting the command to the command line

Once you have the unit test completed for your new command, perform these tasks:

1. Review [https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander](https://www.npmjs.com/package/commander) on commands, options.

1. Update [commands.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/blob/main/coe-cli/src/commands/commands.ts) to include a new command or sub command.

   - Import your files at the top of the file.

   ```typescript
   import { SampleArguments, SampleCommand} from './sample';
   ```

   - Add a function for mock injection.

   ```typescript
       createSampleCommand: () => SampleCommand
   ```

   - Create the command in the constructor function.

   ```typescript
          this.createSampleCommand = () => new SampleCommand
   ```

   - Add the function.

   ```typescript
       AddSampleCommand(program: commander.Command) {
           var run = program.command('sample')
               .description('A new sample command')
               .option('-c, --comment <comment>', 'The comment for the command')
               .action(async (options: any) : Promise<void> => {
                   let args = new SampleArguments();
                   args.comment = options.comment;
                   let command = this.createSampleCommand();
                   await command.execute(args)
               });
       }
   ```

   - Register the new command to init function.

   ```typescript
           this.AddSampleCommand(program);
   ```

1. Update [commands.spec.ts](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/blob/main/coe-cli/test/commands/commands.spec.ts) to include the unit tests.

   - Include a reference to the command.

   ```typescript
   import { SampleCommand } from '../../src/commands/sample'
   ```

   - Add a set of Jest tests.

   ```typescript
   describe('Sample', () => {
       test('Execute', async () => {
           // Arrange
           var commands = new CoeCliCommands();
           let mockSampleCommand = mock<SampleCommand>(); 

           commands.createSampleCommand = () => { return mockSampleCommand }

           mockSampleCommand.execute.mockResolvedValue()
           
           // Act
           await commands.execute(['node', 'commands.spec', 'sample', '-c', 'Some comment'])

           // Assert
           expect(mockSampleCommand.execute).toHaveBeenCalled()
       })
   });
   ```

1. Run the unit tests with the new changes.

   ```bash
   npm run test

   ```
