# CoE ALM Maturity model

The [Power CAT adoption maturity model](../../../../adoption/maturity-model.md) provides a set of levels and capabilities that can be used to evaluate usage of the application lifecycle management (ALM) and how the ALM Accelerator for Power Platform (AA4PP) can assist.

> [!NOTE]
> The ALM accelerator for Microsoft Power Platform is currently in public preview. While in preview we will be prioritizing feedback and bugs via GitHub [New issue](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/labels/alm-accelerator). If the issue is something in the platform all we can do is funnel feedback to the responsible product teams. For more information on the current preview status of the ALM Accelerator for Power Platform [follow this link](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/blob/main/CenterofExcellenceALMAccelerator/PREVIEW.md).

## Quick start

![Decision Tree](./decision-tree.png)

AA4PP is a good match when you verify whether the following apply:

1. Are source control concepts understood?
    - Is [branching and merging](/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance) understood?
    - Are [pull requests](/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?#review-and-merge-code-with-pull-requests) used to review and merge changes?
    - Are [build pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts) used to integrate and deploy between validation, test, and production environments?

1. Are [fusion development](/learn/paths/transform-business-applications-with-fusion-development/) teams engaged to include low code and pro-code teams?

1. Are your professional development teams familiar with [branching and merging](../branching-and-merging.md) strategies and able to assist makers?

1. Support
   - Who is supporting the application and solution?
   - Do you have formal support team to manage issues for the solution?

## Addressing gaps

Where some gaps exist from the leading questions, consider what proactive training and or workshops can help grow the maturity of people, process, and technology to assist them in moving toward advanced maker integration inside your organization.

## Leading questions

### Alignment

The following questions may help with qualifying alignment:

1. Is innovation driven by business areas, such as a bottom up strategy?

1. Is there a defined understanding of Power Platform's role in your organization’s IT portfolio?

1. Are business plans shared across departments?

1. Is vision and strategy understood by all?

1. Do enterprise architecture decisions include Power Platform capabilities?

### Business value

Evaluate the business value looking at:

### Business strategy viability

1. What is the expected time frame?

1. What do you do well today?

1. What do you want to do today better?

1. What thing do you want to do differently?

## Technological viability

Leading questions to consider:

1. What are manual steps vs automated steps?

1. How measurable are the qualitative and quantitative outcomes?

1. What is the dashboard and report capability to allow stakeholders to visualize and drill into and tack action on data?

1. How available are analytics?

1. On what frequency are analytics updated?

1. How frequently are changes required?

## Business impact

### Critical

Production, operations, or deployment deadlines will be severely affected, or there will be a severe impact on production or profitability. Multiple users or services are affected.

Initial response time less than 60 minutes with 24x7 access.

Issues demand an immediate response and require 24x7 operation, every day.

### High

The system has moderate business impact and can be dealt with during business hours. The expected usage could be by multiple users, single users, or customers.

Initial response time one hour, four hours, or next day, business hours access with 24x7 available support.

### Non-critical

The system has minimal business impact. The issue is important but does not have a significant current service or productivity impact. Acceptable workarounds will be considered.
