# CoE ALM Accelerator for Power Platform deployment scenarios

> [!NOTE]
> The ALM accelerator for Microsoft Power Platform is currently in public preview. While in preview we will be prioritizing feedback and bugs via GitHub [New issue](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/labels/alm-accelerator). If the issue is something in the platform all we can do is funnel feedback to the responsible product teams. For more information on the current preview status of the ALM Accelerator for Power Platform see [follow this link](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/blob/main/CenterofExcellenceALMAccelerator/PREVIEW.md).

As you plan your ALM Accelerator for Power Platform (AA4PP) deployment, one or more of the following scenarios might apply to you:

- [Tenant deployments](./tenant-deployments.md) - Discusses different Azure Active Directory configurations across demo, single Azure AD, and multiple Azure AD deployment models.

- [DevOps deployment model](./devops-deployment-model.md) - Discusses the relationship between AA4PP deployments and one or more different Azure DevOps organizations.
