# Set up nurture components

Multiple nurture components are provided in the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit; each will require some configuration to install. The installation instructions in this article have been segmented based on the set of components that should be grouped and installed together, and dependencies on other segments are outlined in each section.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Complete the instructions in [Before setting up the CoE Starter Kit](setup.md) and [Set up inventory components](setup-core-components.md) before continuing with the setup here. This article assumes you have your [environment set up](setup.md#create-your-environments) and are logged in with the [correct identity](setup.md#what-identity-should-i-install-the-coe-starter-kit-with).

## Import the solution

The core components solution is required for the nurture components solution to work.

1. Import the solution: Use the CenterOfExcellenceNurtureComponents_x_x_x_xx_managed.zip file from the download to [install the solution](faq.md#installing-a-solution-in-a-production-environment).
1. Leave all environment variables blank on import.
