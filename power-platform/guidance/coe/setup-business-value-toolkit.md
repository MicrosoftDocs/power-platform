|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Set up business units             | Use the Business Value Admin app and select the **Business units** page. Add the teams, departments, and business units that represent your organization and hierarchy. |
| Add strategic objectives           | Work closely with the various teams and departments to capture the objectives and how they're measuring progress towards them. This is a crucial component of the sample solution. Assign strategic objectives to the relevant team or department. |
| Add the average cost of things            | This data is used to calculate the tangible impact an app is having against a strategic objective. Work with your teams and departments to add this data. This data is assigned to business units. |

### Schema overview of the Business Value Admin App

The schema below outlines the various tables and columns used within the Business Value Admin app, detailing their specific purposes.

| Table             | Column            | Purpose |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------|
| Business unit     | Name              | Identifies the name of the business unit, team, or department. |
| Business unit     | Parent business   | Links a business unit, team, or department to its overarching entity. |
| Strategic objective | Name            | Names the strategic objective such as _Foster a safe and healthy work environment_. |
| Strategic objective | Description     | Provides detailed information about the strategic objective. For example _Contoso prioritizes employee well-being by ensuring a safe and healthy workplace_. |

Since strategic objectives are often decentralized and embedded within individual units, gathering this information directly from the teams involved is crucial. Engage with these teams to gain a thorough understanding of their strategic goals and the average costs associated with their operations.

## Assess the value of an existing app

The Business value toolkit is designed to systematically capture and articulate the story behind the app, ensuring organizations can consistently produce high-quality success stories. Using generative AI capabilities through the _create text using a prompt_ action in Power Automate, the toolkit enhances the narrative quality of these stories and analyzes for alignment and impact on strategic goals of the organization.

### AI-enhanced success story generation

The toolkit employs specific prompts within Power Automate to enhance and refine the narratives provided by app owners. The following information is an overview of the prompts used in this process.

| Prompt name                  | Description                                                                                                                      | Where used                     |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Generate enhanced success story | This prompt transforms the initial story text into a polished format similar to a business magazine article. It also converts the text into HTML for publication on SharePoint Online, pending approval from the app owner. | Cloud flow: AI-EnhancedStoryGen |
| Review and refine the story    | This prompt further refines the enhanced story, improving readability and flow by processing the AI-generated content through more refinement stages. | Cloud flow: AI-EnhancedStoryGen |

These prompts facilitate the creation of engaging and well-structured success stories that resonate with business audiences, making complex app functionalities accessible and relatable.

#### Story data schema

The following table illustrates the data schema relating to stories and proposals.

| Table                              | Column                     | Purpose                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Value assessment stories    | AI assist                   | If story has been enhanced with generative AI. |

| Value assessment stories    | Story title                   | Title of story or proposal. |

### Story approval and communication

Before a story is shared within the organization, it must receive user approval. Once approved, the story is created as a news article in SharePoint Online. Initially, as an unpublished page, the article then requires an administrator or a user with appropriate permissions to finalize it by adding images and making any necessary adjustments before publishing.

> [!NOTE]
>To integrate with SharePoint Online, ensure you populate the environment variable: **CommunityHubUrl**. This URL should point to a SharePoint Online site collection provisioned using the communications site template. Success stories are housed within the Pages library. For instance, your SharePoint site URL might resemble: `https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/power-platform-coe`. You should also ensure the account that the cloud flow runs with has at least **Member** access in the SharePoint Online site collection.

#### Add value cards to a success story in SharePoint Online

The Business value toolkit provides a canvas app, **Display value card in SharePoint Online**, that can be added to the success story. The following steps explain how to add and configure the canvas app.

Complete the following steps before you edit the page in SharePoint Online.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com?utm_source=padocs&utm_medium=linkinadoc&utm_campaign=referralsfromdoc).
1. Select **Solutions** .
1. Select **Business Value** > **Apps**.
1. Select the ellipsis (**...**) next to the canvas app named **Display value cards in SharePoint Online**.
1. Copy the web link.
1. Copy the **Story ID** of the success story that you want to add the canvas app to.
