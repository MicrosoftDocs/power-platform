# Data Export inventory setup

## Dataflow Setup

You can set up dataflows to retrieve your inventory from Data Export.

If your inventory is coming from [Data Export](setup.md#what-data-source-should-i-use-for-my-power-platform-inventory), you can configure dataflows as part of the setup.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - Only complete the steps in this artcle if you configured [Data Export](setup.md#what-data-source-should-i-use-for-my-power-platform-inventory) as the mechanism for inventory and telemetry.
> - When you see data in your storage account set up to receive data from Data Export, then use the Data Export configuration steps in this article. This configuration might show up to five days from the initial setup of Data Export in the Power Platform admin center.

### Copy Azure Storage account URL

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for or select the storage account configured to receive [Data Export data](/power-platform/admin/self-service-analytics#set-up-the-data-export-process-for-your-tenant).
1. Select **Endpoints**.
1. Copy the Data Lake Storage URL to a text editor such as Notepad.
   :::image type="content" source="media/byodl-1.png" alt-text="Screenshot the shows where to get the URL from your Data Lake Storage field in your Endpoints settings." lightbox="media/byodl-1.png":::

1. Append `/powerplatform` to the URL.

### Confirm Storage Account permission

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Search for and select the storage account configured to receive [Data Export data](/power-platform/admin/self-service-analytics#set-up-the-data-export-process-for-your-tenant).
1. Select **Access Control (IAM)**.
1. Select **View my access**.
1. Confirm you have the Storage Blob Data Reader role assigned.
   :::image type="content" source="media/byodl-2.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Current role assignments page in the Access Control (IAM) menu." lightbox="media/byodl-2.png":::

### Copy Environment Web API endpoint

1. Navigate to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com).

1. Confirm that the **CoE BYODL Apps** and **CoE BYODL Model Driven Apps** dataflows are configured to load data to the existing **admin_App** table. The **CoE BYODL Flows** dataflow should be configured to load data to the existing **admin_Flow** table.
1. Publish the **CoE BYODL Apps**, **CoE BYODL Model Driven Apps**, and **CoE BYODL Flows** dataflows and wait for the refresh to finish.
   :::image type="content" source="media/byodl-17.png" alt-text="Screenshot that highlights the CoE BYODL Apps and CoE BYODL Flows dataflows." lightbox="media/byodl-17.png":::

### Troubleshooting

#### The specified path doesn't exist

This dataSource error means not all required folders and files are available yet in the storage account, since you recently configured the Data Export. After the initial setup, seeing updated data can take up to five days for folders to populate.
:::image type="content" source="media/byodl-21.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the data source error if the required folders aren't yet available in the storage account." lightbox="media/byodl-21.png":::

#### A DataFormat.Error after updating the `DatalakeURL` and `EnvironmentAPI` parameters

This error might mean you entered the incorrect URLs. Verify that the `DatalakeURL` parameter points to your Azure Storage account URL. The URL should contain `dfs.core` and end with `/powerplatform`. Verify that the `EnvironmentAPI` points to your Environment Web API. The URL should contain `api.crm` and end with `/api/data/v9.2`.
:::image type="content" source="media/byodl-18.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the DataFormat.Error." lightbox="media/byodl-18.png":::

#### The publish or refresh failed

Select the error to review the status alert in the **Last refresh** column.
:::image type="content" source="media/byodl-15.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where you can select the error to reveal the alert." lightbox="media/byodl-15.png":::

The refresh might fail if you didn't configure connections to all data sources used by the dataflow. Edit the dataflow again and verify you configured the connections to all data sources. Select all the queries individually to check for warnings.
:::image type="content" source="media/byodl-14.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the refresh history window with a summary of the error." lightbox="media/byodl-14.png":::

#### The publish button is disabled

If you configured connections in the dataflow, but the **Publish** button remains disabled (with a warning message), some configured connections might be missing. Select **Back** and review all queries for connection warnings.
:::image type="content" source="media/byodl-16.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing one possible warning." lightbox="media/byodl-16.png":::

### Configure scheduled refresh

1. Navigate to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Select the environment installed with the CoE Starter Kit.
1. Select **Dataflows**.
1. Select **Edit refresh settings** for the **CoE BYODL Makers** dataflow.
   :::image type="content" source="media/byodl-5.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Edit refresh settings option from the overflow menu of a dataflow." lightbox="media/byodl-5.png":::
1. Select **Refresh automatically** and configure a daily refresh. Check when files write to your storage account by the Data Export feature and set the daily refresh of the dataflow *after* that time. The dataflow now runs after data is exported to your storage account.
