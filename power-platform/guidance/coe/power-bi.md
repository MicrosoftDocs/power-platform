# CoE Power BI dashboard for Power Platform Admins

As a Microsoft Power Platform admin, you want visibility into how your organization uses Power Apps and Power Automate. Insights into your adoption help you govern and secure the platform, identify patterns, and enable you to nurture your makers to accelerate adoption.

Out of the box, the [Admin Analytics for Power Apps](../../admin/analytics-powerapps.md) that are part of the [Power Platform admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac) provide you with environment-level analytics based on your usage for the past 28 days. As your adoption grows, you might need customized dashboards that show you more insights and allow you to apply richer filters to your data over a longer period.

The Power BI dashboard of the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit provides a holistic view with visualizations and insights into resources in your tenant: environments, apps, Power Automate flows, connectors, connection references, makers, and audit logs. Telemetry from the audit log is stored from the moment you set up the CoE Starter Kit, so over time you can look back and identify trends for longer than 28 days.

The dashboard provides analytics and data for the following areas:

- [**Monitor with the CoE Power BI dashboard**](power-bi-monitor.md): Oversight of tenant resources

- [**Govern with the CoE Power BI dashboard**](power-bi-govern.md): Drive actions through insights

- [**Nurture in the CoE Power BI dashboard**](power-bi-nurture.md): Learn about your community

Get ready to use the dashboard by installing the [Set up inventory components](setup-core-components.md) and configuring the Power BI dashboard by following the [Set up the Power BI dashboard](setup-powerbi.md).

>[!NOTE]
>Screenshots are taken from a sample of the report that's [published as an app](/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-create-distribute-apps). If you're working in Power BI Desktop or you publish the report to a workspace, your navigation and view are different.

The first page of the dashboard provides an overview of all areas and their purpose, in addition to buttons to use to go to different sections and pages.
