# Nurture in the CoE Power BI dashboard

As you establish your Center of Excellence (CoE), a significant part of your activity will be nurturing your maker community, enabling them to follow best practices and working together with them to identify whether they need more support.

The **Nurture** section helps you find your "star" app and flow makers and see what connectors they're using, where they're based (department/city/country), and how they're adopting Microsoft Power Platform.

## Makers

The **Maker** page helps you see your top makers, how many apps and flows those makers have created, your top active departments, and where your makers are based.

## Year-over-year (YoY) adoption

The **YoY Adoption** page shows your year-over-year adoption of Power Platform. This page highlights growth in number of apps, cloud flows, desktop flows, chatbots, environments, and makers, and shows you the percentage increase or decrease year-on-year.

## Power Apps adoption

The **Power Apps Adoption** page shows you further insights into how Power Apps is getting adopted in your organization. This page highlights total and monthly new users, and month-on-month growth of users. This page additionally shows Power Apps monthly active users (MAU) and Premium MAU over time, and the number of apps using Azure, SharePoint, and Dataverse as data sources.

### Desktop flows usage

The **Desktop flows usage** page provides an overview of UI-based robotic process automateion (RPA) flow runs in your environment:

- Number of runs per date and desktop flow type
- Total number of runs
- Last run date and status

Filters on this page can help you narrow down this view by desktop flow type, run status, maker, and environment.
