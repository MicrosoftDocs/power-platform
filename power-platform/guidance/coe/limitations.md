# Limitations

There is no "one size fits all" solution for a Center of Excellence (CoE). Some companies will want a restrictive set of rules on their organization in hopes of mitigating the unknown, while others will want to let users personally explore without limitations. Because of this, the CoE Starter Kit doesn't come equipped with a set of design patterns for everyone. If your organization wants a more restrictive implementation, it must implement those restrictions in addition to using the tools from the starter kit.

The following sections describe limitations for some components.

## Long running flows

There are some flows, which crawl the tenant in order to do their work. Specifically, the inventory flows in Core solution and the start archival flows in Governance solution.

To help ensure service levels, availability, and quality, there are entitlement limits to the number of requests users can make each day across Power Apps, Power Automate. Learn more: [Requests limits and allocations](../../admin/api-request-limits-allocations.md)

Larger tenants might require a per flow license in order for these flows to complete in a timely manner. More information: [Power Automate License Pricing](https://flow.microsoft.com/pricing/)

You can also [raise a support ticket](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/issues/917) to request an exception from throttling limits.

>[!TIP]
>The first run of the Sync flows in the Core Solution will run long as it will do an update for every flow/app/etc in the tenant. Subsequent runs  will only update apps/flows/etc that have changed since the last run and so these will not require a per flow license for most tenants.

## Incomplete Inventory

The sync flows in the Core Component solution will only update resources that have changed since the last run. After an upgrade, you will only see the benefits of bug fixes or changes when you run a full inventory sync:

1) Set the value of the **Full inventory** environment variable to *Yes* (Learn more: [update environment variables](setup-core-components.md#update-environment-variables)).
1) Turn all flows in the Center of Excellence - Core Components solution off, and back on.
1) Run the *Admin | Sync Template v3* flow.
1) Set the **Full inventory** environment variable back to *No*.
1) Turn all flows in Core off and back on

## Dataverse for Teams

Model Driven Apps, Business Process Flows and Custom Connectors are not available in Dataverse for Teams. If you are installing the CoE Starter Kit in Dataverse for Teams, you will notice those components missing.

## Sync flow limitations for Developer and Microsoft Team environments

It currently isn't possible to retrieve the model-driven apps, chatbots, and Desktop flows for developer environments (*My Name's* environment) and Microsoft Teams environments.

## Updating Environment Variables

You cannot update the values for environment variables from within the solution.

To update Environment Variables:

1. If you have installed the solution in a Production environment:
   1. Go to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).
   1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.
   1. Select the **Default Solution**, and change the filter to show **Environment Variables**.
   1. Select a variable that you want to update, and then configure its **Current Value**.

1. If you have installed the solution in a Dataverse for Teams environment:
   1. Go to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).
   1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.
   1. Select the **Common Data Services Default Solution**.
   1. Select **+ Add > Environment Variables**.
   1. Select the existing Environment Variables from the managed solution that you want to update.
   1. Now, change the filter to show **Environment Variables**.
   1. Select a variable that you want to update, and then configure its **Current Value**.

## Timeouts in the Admin | Sync Template v3

The Dataverse connector might experience some throttling limits if the tenant has many resources. If you see 429 errors in the flow run history occurring in later runs, you can try the following resolution steps:

- **Configure the retry policy**
  1. Open **Admin \| Sync Template v3**, and then select **Edit**.
  1. Expand the step **Get Environments and store them in the CoE Table**.
  1. Expand the step **Apply to each Environment**
  1. Go to the **Settings** pane for each call to Dataverse, and configure the timeout/retry settings. The default count is set to **10** and the default interval is set to **PT10S** - increase the values incrementally here.

- **Configure (reduce) concurrency in Foreach loops to reduce simultaneous calls**
  1. Open **Admin \| Sync Template v3**, and then select **Edit**.
  1. Expand the step **Get Environments and store them in the CoE Table**.
  1. Go to **Settings** for the **Apply to each Environment** step.

     ![Configure concurrency in Foreach.](media/coe73.PNG "Configure concurrency in Foreach")

  1. Use the slider to reduce the value of **Degree of Parallelism**. The default value is 50; reducing the parallelism here will increase the runtime of the flow, start by gradually lowering the number.

## Coauth and Connections

If you have multiple identities managing the CoE Toolkit you may see this error when trying to use the flows:

`The caller with object id '...GUID...' does not have permission for connection...`

This is because the product does not yet support multiple people using connection references.

If you see this you should either log in with the identity that installed the solution to run the flows, or update the flows to use your identity.

To do the later, browse to the default solution, filter to connection references, and edit each connection to use your connection instead.

## Developer environments from the Power Apps Community Plan

Microsoft Power Platform protects developer-type SKUs from inquiry by non-authenticated users. This configuration means that the model-driven apps in developer SKUs will be skipped from our tally work in the sync flow Admin | Sync Template v3 (Model Driven Apps).

To fix this, you must have your admin security role added to the security roles for all developer environments, and then remove the selection from the sync flow. More information: [Power Apps Community Plan](/powerapps/maker/dev-community-plan)

## Supported languages

The CoE Starter Kit solutions are not localized, and only support English. Add the English language pack to your environment to make sure all apps and flows work. More information: [Regional and language options for your environment](/power-platform/admin/enable-languages)

## Security groups and approvals

Using security groups to control access to the CoE environment is not recommended, because it's likely that users who don't have access to this environment will be participating in approvals.
If a security group is used to control access, users will have to be a part of that group to work with the archival solutions.

## Shared component library in the theming components solution

The shared component library in the [theming components solution](theming-components.md) isn't editable. Make your own copy if you want to extend it.

## Trial licenses

Trial licenses do not have sufficient [API call allowances](/power-automate/limits-and-config#concurrency-looping-and-debatching-limits) to run the CoE Starter Kit flows.
For full list of license requirements see [Setup Prerequisite](setup.md#prerequisites).

## PIM (Privileged Identity Management)

If your Power Platform admin role is managed via **[PIM](/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-getting-started)** ensure the Sync Flows of the Core Components solution are set up to complete during the time whilst your user is granted admin permission. If your user loses admin access during the run of the sync flows, you may end up with incomplete or incorrect data if you use PIM and your Power Platform Admin Role.

## Monitoring cloud flow runs

Monitoring Cloud flow runs is currently not included in the CoE Starter Kit. Monitoring Desktop flow runs is included, although limited.

If you want more details for Desktop flows runs please see this solution available outside the CoE Starter Kit: [Advanced Power Automate RPA Run Log Analytics with PowerBI and Dataverse](https://flow.microsoft.com/blog/advanced-power-automate-rpa-run-log-analytics-with-power-bi-and-dataverse/)

## Unpublished model-driven apps

Model-driven apps that are not published are not surfaced in the inventory because the are not returned to us from the storage table. This is a product limitation and will not be fixed in the sync flows.  

## Large desktop flows

Desktop Flows that are large are not surfaced in the inventory because one of the fields returned is too big for the flows.  This is a product limitation that will be fixed when the new Dataverse connector allows us to select environments.

## Missing custom connectors

Only custom connectors outside of solutions, and all custom connectors inside a solution that the identity running the Admin | Sync Flow v3 (Custom Connectors) has access to are available in the inventory. Custom connectors inside a solution, to which the identity running the sync flows does not have access, will not show up in the inventory.
