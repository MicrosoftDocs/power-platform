# ALM Accelerator for Power Platform (AA4PP) : Learning Catalog

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> The ALM accelerator for Microsoft Power Platform is currently in public preview. While in preview we will be prioritizing feedback and bugs via GitHub [New issue](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/labels/alm-accelerator). If the issue is something in the platform all we can do is funnel feedback to the responsible product teams. For more information on the current preview status of the ALM Accelerator for Power Platform [follow this link](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/blob/main/CenterofExcellenceALMAccelerator/PREVIEW.md).

The  ALM Accelerator for Power Platform  includes a canvas app that sits on top of Azure DevOps Pipelines and Git source control. The app provides a simplified interface for makers to regularly export the components in their  [Power Platform Solutions](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/alm/solution-concepts-alm)  to source control and create deployment requests to have their work reviewed before deploying to target environments.

The  ALM Accelerator for Power Platform is a complement to the ALM guidance available under the [Overview of application lifecycle management with Microsoft Power Platform](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform/alm/overview-alm). It was originally developed to facilitate ALM for the CoE Starter Kit team. We are now sharing what we’ve built for our own use and open sourcing it to help you understand how you can apply ALM patterns & practices with the Power Platform. You can use the ALM Accelerator as-is, customize it to meet your requirements, or as a reference implementation to see how we’ve addressed ALM scenarios.
