# Released version Core Components 1.54

## Bug Fixes

This version fixed a bug in the **Admin | Sync Template v3 (Power Apps User Shared With)** flow, which caused fetching user permissions in Default environment to fail.

This version fixed a bug in the **Admin | Sync Template v3 (Model Driven Apps)** flow, which caused environments with crm urls not ending in .crm to fail to sync. Example impacts are environments like those with *crm4* in the url.
