# Released version Audit Log Components 1.1

Version 1.1 for the CoE Starter Kit Audit Log Components is now available. This article describes the updates, including new features and fixes to existing functionality in this release. This version was first made available on September 18, 2020.

## Table changes

Connection references are added to the solution to support the new modern import solution experience. All flows have been updated to use connection references, rather than connections.

## Custom Connector

To help with the setup, the custom connector used in the [Audit Log components](../setup-auditlog.md) is removed from this solution and added to the core solution.
