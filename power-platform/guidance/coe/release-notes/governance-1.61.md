# Released version Governance Components 1.61

Version 1.60 for the CoE Starter Kit Governance Components is now available. This article describes the updates, including the new features and the fixes to existing functionality, included in this release. This version was first made available on June 1, 2021.

## Developer Compliance Center

Bug fix to address an issue where the link to the Flow Settings page from Developer Compliance Center was not working.

## Clean-up Old Objects App

A canvas app has been added to help makers and managers action archive requests.

## Connection References

Connection References used by all cloud flows have been renamed and now use *CoE Gov - Connector Name* as a naming convention. Dependencies on connection references between solutions have been removed, and all connection references are now only used by the solution they are shipped with.
