# Released version Core Components 1.70

Version 1.70 for the CoE Starter Kit Core Components is now available. This article describes the updates, including the new features and the fixes to existing functionality in this release. This version was first made available on September 21, 2020.

## Modern Solution Import Experience

Connection References are added to the solution to support the new modern import solution experience. All flows are updated to use connection references, rather than connections. The [setup instructions](../setup-core-components.md) are updated to describe the new setup experience.

## Table changes

Tables **RPA** and **RPA Session** are added to support inventory and analytics for desktop Flows.

## Power BI Dashboard

The [Power BI Dashboard](../power-bi-monitor.md#desktop-flows) is updated to show desktop flow inventory and run details.

## Custom Connector

To help with the setup, the custom connector used in the [Audit Log components](../setup-auditlog.md) is removed from the Audit Log solution and added to this solution.

## Deprecation

The DLP Editor and DLP Customizer canvas apps are deprecated due to limitations with the DLP actions in the Power Platform for Admins connector.
