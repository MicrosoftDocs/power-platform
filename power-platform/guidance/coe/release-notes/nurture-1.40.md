# Released version Nurture Components 1.40

Version 1.40 for the CoE Starter Kit Nurture Components is now available. This article describes the updates, including the new features and the fixes to existing functionality, included in this release. This version was first made available in preview on April 8, 2021.

## Canvas Apps

All canvas apps have been updated to use responsive layout containers and a new theme.

## Moving components to Core

Admin | Welcome email (flow) and App catalog (canvas app) have been moved to Core components in an effort to allow Nurture components to be used standalone.

## Maker Assessment app

The Maker Assessment app has been added to this solution. This app can be used to ask users a series of questions regarding the target audience, data and support of the solution they are planning and informing them about governance, support and license considerations a maker needs to keep in mind before starting the development of their solution.
