# Released version Core Components 2.1

Version 2.1 for the CoE Starter Kit Core Components is now available. This article describes the updates, including the new features and the fixes to existing functionality, included in this release. This version was first made available on May 5, 2021.

## Moving components from Nurture and Governance

Admin | Welcome email (flow) and App catalog (canvas app) have been moved from Nurture components to Core components in an effort to allow Nurture components to be used standalone.

Admin | Compliance detail request has been moved from Governance components to Core components to accommodate changes to make this flow compatible with Dataverse for Teams environments.
