# Released version Core Components 1.70.6

Version 1.70.6 for the CoE Starter Kit Core Components is now available. This article describes the updates, including the new features and the fixes to existing functionality, included in this release. This version was first made available on October 16, 2020.

## Sync Flows

Some of our Sync flows were impacted by [throughput limits](/power-automate/limits-and-config#throughput-limits), we have therefore re-designed them to run less frequently or only run when information has been modified.
