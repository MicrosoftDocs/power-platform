# Set up clean-up for orphaned objects

This article will help you to set up the clean-up for orphaned objects.

You use this functionality to identify objects where the maker has left the organization, and ask managers to maintain permissions of their former employees.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This article assumes you have [installed the governance components solution](before-setup-gov.md), and you have your [environment set up](setup.md#create-your-environments) and are signed in with the [correct identity](setup.md#what-identity-should-i-install-the-coe-starter-kit-with).

>[!NOTE]
>The flows supporting this processes post adaptive cards to users using the [Microsoft Teams](/connectors/teams/) connector. The ability to post adaptive cards in Teams is not available in GCC High and DoD. These flows should remain turned off in these regions as they will not work.

[Watch a walk-through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zptiBppTNo&list=PLi9EhCY4z99W5kzaPK1np6sv6AzMQDsXG) of how the clean-up for orphaned objects process works.

## Set up the Clean-up for orphaned objects components manually

### Turn on flows

Turn on the following flows, which are installed as part of the governance components solution:

- [Request Orphaned Objects Reassigned (Child)](governance-components.md#request-orphaned-objects-reassigned-child)
- [Request Orphaned Objects Reassigned (Parent)](governance-components.md#request-orphaned-objects-reassigned-parent)

## It looks like I found a bug with the CoE Starter Kit; where should I go?

To file a bug against the solution, go to [aka.ms/coe-starter-kit-issues](https://aka.ms/coe-starter-kit-issues).
