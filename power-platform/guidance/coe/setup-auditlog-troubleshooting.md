# Troubleshooting sync problems in audit logs

## API permissions

Go to your app registration and validate that you have the correct API permissions. Your app registration requires application permissions not delegated. Validate that the status is _Granted_.

## Secret environment variable - Azure secret

If you're using Azure Key value to store the app registration secret, validate that the Azure Key Vault permissions are correct.

A user needs to be in the _Key Vault Secret User_ role to read and in the _Key Vault Contributor_ role to update.

If you have other issues with Azure Key Vault regarding a firewall, static IPs for the Dataverse environment, or other such feature issues, contact product support to resolve them.

## Secret environment variable - plain text

If you're using plain text to store the app registration secret, validate that you entered the secret value itself, and not the secret ID. The secret value is a longer string with a larger character set than a GUID. For example, the string might have tilde characters.
