# Set up Dataverse for Teams environment management

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The flows supporting this processes post adaptive cards to users using the [Microsoft Teams](/connectors/teams/) connector. The ability to post adaptive cards in Teams is not available in GCC High and DoD.
> It is important that these flows remain **turned off** in these regions as they will not work fully. If turned on, makers will never receive the request to submit a business justification via an adaptive card and the [weekly cleanup](teams-governance.md#monitoring-and-weekly-cleanup-process) will remove all Dataverse for Teams environments as none have a business justification submitted. 

This article will help you to setup the Dataverse for Teams environment management components of the Governance solution. Learn more: [Microsoft Dataverse for Teams environment management](teams-governance.md)

This set of functionality allows you to monitor new Dataverse for Teams environments.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This article assumes you have [installed the governance components solution](before-setup-gov.md) and you have your [environment setup](setup.md#create-your-environments), and are logged in with the [correct identity](setup.md#what-identity-should-i-install-the-coe-starter-kit-with).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Automatically deleting inactive Dataverse for Teams environment is now part of the product - you can configure Teams environment deletion policies from the Power Platform Admin center. Learn more: [Automatic deletion of inactive Microsoft Dataverse for Teams environments](../../admin/inactive-teams-environment.md). <br>
>As there is parity between this feature, and the functionality in the CoE Starter Kit we will remove that portion of the features below from the CoE starter kit once the native support in the product is available broadly in all clouds.

### Exempt environments from the empty environment processes

You may want to exempt certain environments from the empty environment cleanup process. You can exempt environments from the this process using the Power Platform Admin View app.
