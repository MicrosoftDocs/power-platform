# Set up Dataverse for Teams environment management

>[!IMPORTANT]
>The flows supporting this processes post adaptive cards to users using the [Microsoft Teams](/connectors/teams/) connector. The ability to post adaptive cards in Teams is not available in GCC High and DoD.
> It is important that these flows remain **turned off** in these regions as they will not work fully. If turned on, makers will never receive the request to submit a business justification via an adaptive card and the [weekly cleanup](teams-governance.md#monitoring-and-weekly-cleanup-process) will remove all Dataverse for Teams environments as none have a business justification submitted. 

This article will help you to setup the Dataverse for Teams environment management components of the Governance solution. Learn more: [Microsoft Dataverse for Teams environment management](teams-governance.md)

This set of functionality allows you to monitor new Dataverse for Teams environments.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This article assumes you have [installed the governance components solution](before-setup-gov.md) and you have your [environment setup](setup.md#create-your-environment), and are logged in with the [correct identity](setup.md#what-identity-should-i-install-the-coe-starter-kit-with).

## Turn on flows

Turn on these flows which are installed as part of the **Governance components** solution:

- [Microsoft Teams Admin | Weekly Clean Up of Microsoft Teams environments](governance-components.md#microsoft-teams-admin--weekly-clean-up-of-microsoft-teams-environments)
- [Microsoft Teams Admin | Ask for Business Justification when Microsoft Teams environment is created](governance-components.md#microsoft-teams-admin--ask-for-business-justification-when-microsoft-teams-environment-is-created)
- [Microsoft Teams Admin | Send Reminder Mail](governance-components.md#microsoft-teams-admin--send-reminder-mail)

## It looks like I found a bug with the CoE Starter Kit; where should I go?
