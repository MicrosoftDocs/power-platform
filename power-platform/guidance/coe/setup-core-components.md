# Set up core components

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

The Center of Excellence (CoE) core components solution provides components that you need to get started with setting up a CoE. They sync all your resources into tables and build admin apps on top of that to help you get more visibility into the apps, flows, and makers that exist in your environment. Additionally, apps like DLP Editor and Set App Permissions help with daily admin tasks.  

The core components solution contains assets that are only relevant to admins.

<!-- need to re-record due to new solution import experience Watch the [setup instructions video](https://youtu.be/L8gKjeE5GR4) to help you download and deploy the solution. -->

## Import the solution

The Core Components can be used in both Production environments and Dataverse for Teams environments. Where you install it will depend on your organization setup, your adoption of Microsoft Power Platform so far and what you want to achieve with the CoE Starter Kit. Before you decide, compare [Dataverse vs Dataverse for Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/teams/data-platform-compare)

Learn more: [What is Dataverse for Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/teams/overview-data-platform)

### Option 1: Import the solution into a Production environment

This is the first step of the installation process and is required for every other component in the starter kit to work. You'll need to create an environment in which to set up the CoE. For more information about how to decide on the best strategy for your organization, go to [Establishing an Environment Strategy for Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/guidance/adoption/environment-strategy) and [Environment strategy for ALM](/power-platform/alm/environment-strategy-alm).


1. Download the CoE Starter Kit compressed file ([aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload](https://aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload)).

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > **Extract the zip file** after downloading and before moving on to the next step. The CoE Starter Kit compressed file contains all solution components as well as non-solution aware components that make up the CoE Starter Kit.

1. Create an environment in which to set up the CoE.

   1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
   1. Select **Environments** > **+ New**, and then enter a name, type, and purpose.
   1. Select **Yes** for creating the database, and then select **Next**.
   1. Leave **Sample apps and data** set to **No**
   1. Select **Save**.

1. Go to your new environment.

    1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](<https://make.powerapps.com>).
    1. Go to the environment you just created, in which the CoE solution will be hosted. In the example in the following screenshot, we're importing to the environment named **Contoso CoE**.

     ![Power Apps maker portal environment selection](media/coe6.png "Power Apps maker portal environment selection")

1. Create connections to all connectors used as part of the solution.
    1. Go to **Data** > **Connections**.
    1. Select **+ New Connection**.
    1. Select **Dataverse**.
     ![Select the Datavsere connector](media/msi-connection.png "Select the Dataverse connector")
    1. Select **Create**.
    1. Complete the same steps for the following connectors:
        - Common Data Service
        - Common Data Service (current environment)
        - Power Apps for Admins
        - Power Apps for Makers
        - Power Platform for Admins
        - Power Automate for Admins
        - Power Automate Management
        - Office 365 Users
        - Office 365 Outlook
        - Office 365 Groups
        - SharePoint
        - Microsoft Teams

1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.

1. Select **Import**, and then **Browse**.

1. Select the Center of Excellence core components solution from File Explorer (CenterOfExcellenceCoreComponents_*x_x_x_xx*_managed.zip).

1. When the compressed (.zip) file has been loaded, select **Next**.

1. Review the information, and then select **Next**.
1. Establish connections to activate your solution. If you create a new connection, you must select **Refresh**. You won't lose your import progress.

     ![Establish connections to activate your solution](media/msi-import.png "Establish connections to activate your solution.")

1. Update environment variable values. The environment variables are used to store application and flow configuration data with data specific to your organization or environment. This means that you only have to set the value once per environment and it will be used in all necessary flows and apps in that environment. All the flows in the solution depend on all environment variables' being configured.

    Configure the following variables for the core components solution, and then select **Save**. (If you need to change the value of an environment variable after you import the solution, go to [Update environment variables](#update-environment-variables).)

    | Name | Current Value |
    |------|---------------|
    |Power Automate environment variable | For a US environment: <https://us.flow.microsoft.com/manage/environments/> <br>For an EMEA environment: <https://emea.flow.microsoft.com/manage/environments/> <br>For a GCC environment: <https://gov.flow.microsoft.us/manage/environments/> |
    |Admin eMail                         | Email address used in flows to send notifications to admins; this should be either your email address or a distribution list |
    | Power Platform Maker Office 365 Group | The Admin \| Welcome Email flow sends a welcome email to onboard new makers and adds them to an Office 365 group. You can use this group to send communications to your makers or invite them to a Yammer or Teams group. Configure the group ID here.|

     ![Update environment variable values](media/msi-envvar.png "Update environment variable values")

1. Select **Import**.

The import can take up to 10 minutes to be completed.

### Option 2: Import the solution into a Dataverse for Teams environment

This is the first step of the installation process and is required for every other component in the starter kit to work.

Before you begin:

- decide which team to add the Core Components solution to or create a new team.
- [install the Power Apps app](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/teams/install-personal-app) in Teams.
- [create your first app](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/teams/create-first-app) (at least one app is required in the environment to enable the solution import experience).

1. Download the CoE Starter Kit compressed file ([aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload](https://aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload)).

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > **Extract the zip file** after downloading and before moving on to the next step. The CoE Starter Kit compressed file contains all solution components as well as non-solution aware components that make up the CoE Starter Kit.

1. Open to the Power Apps app in Teams, select **Build**, and select the Team you want to add the solution to.

1. Select **See All**

    ![Open the Power Apps app in Teams to import a new solution.](media/ibteams-1.png "Open the Power Apps app in Teams to import a new solution.")

1. Select **Import**

1. In the pop-up window, select **Choose File**.

    - Common Data Service (current environment)
    - Power Apps for Admins
    - Power Apps for Makers
    - Power Platform for Admins
    - Power Automate for Admins
    - Power Automate Management
    - Office 365 Users
    - Office 365 Outlook
    - Office 365 Groups
    - SharePoint

    If you create a new connection, you must select **Refresh**. You won't lose your import progress.

     ![Establish connections to all connectors used in the solution](media/coreteams-1.png "Establish connections to all connectors used in the solution.")

1. Update environment variable values. The environment variables are used to store application and flow configuration data with data specific to your organization or environment. This means that you only have to set the value once per environment and it will be used in all necessary flows and apps in that environment. All the flows in the solution depend on all environment variables' being configured.

    Configure the following variables for the core components solution, and then select **Save**. (If you need to change the value of an environment variable after you import the solution, go to [Update environment variables](#update-environment-variables).)

    | Name | Current Value |
    |------|---------------|
    |Power Automate environment variable | For a US environment: <https://us.flow.microsoft.com/manage/environments/> <br>For an EMEA environment: <https://emea.flow.microsoft.com/manage/environments/> <br>For a GCC environment: <https://gov.flow.microsoft.us/manage/environments/> |

     ![Set environment variable values](media/coreteams-2.png "Set environment variable values.")

1. Select **Import**.

The import can take up to 60 minutes to be completed.

## Activate the sync template flows

The flows with the prefix *Sync* are required for populating and cleaning up data in the Dataverse tables (Environment, Power Apps App, Flow, Flow Action Detail, Connector, and Maker). The sync flows are used to write or delete data from the admin connectors to the Dataverse tables. These flows run on a schedule.

Note that the first run of these will be long running. See the [limitations information](limitations.md) for more details.
We will avoid issues by enabling the flows in an explicit order. We recommend you repeat this order on each upgrade as well.

1) Turn on: CLEANUP - Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Check Deleted)
1) Wait until it finishes before you turn on any other flows.
1) Ensure the Sync Template flows are already turned on for the following object types:<br> Apps, Connectors, Custom Connectors, Flows, Model Driven Apps, PVA, RPA
1) Turn on Admin \| Sync Template v3. When it completes, turn it back off.
1) This will cause the flows for the objects listed in step 3 to run. Wait until all of these complete.
1) Turn back on Admin \| Sync Template v3.
1) Turn on the rest of the flows listed in the solution

## Configure the CoE Settings table

This section explains how to enter data in the CoE Settings table. This table will hold a single row of information that contains your logo, brand colors, and so on, which different applications will reference.

The following assets depend on the CoE Settings table:

- **Canvas apps**: The optional branding details (logo, brand colors) in all canvas apps are pulled from this table. Optional support and community channel links are also used.
- **Optional flows**: The optional branding details and support channel links are used in communication flows. You'll also configure links to canvas apps in the settings. (The main flow that syncs data to the resource tables doesn't depend on this setting configuration.)
<!--markdownlint-disable MD036-->

The following values are expected for these settings:

   | Setting | Value |
   |------|------------|
   | Company Name | Your company name as it will appear in dashboards |
   |Brand Logo | Link to your logo as an image file |
   | Brand Primary Color          | Hexadecimal value of your primary brand color (\#CCCCCC) |
   | Brand Secondary Color        | Hexadecimal value of your secondary brand color (\#DDDDDD)   |
   | Email End User Support       | Email address for your helpdesk or user computing support team      |
   | Email Maker Support          | Email address for your Microsoft Power Platform maker support team           |
   | Tenant Type | The type of tenant you have. Possible values:<ul><li>**Commercial** (use if your URL is https://make.powerapps.com)</li><li>**GCC** (use if your URL is https://make.gov.powerapps.us)</li><li>**GCC High** (use if your URL is https://make.high.powerapps.us)</li></ul> |
   | Link to Community Channel    | Link to your internal Microsoft Power Platform community (for example, Yammer or Teams)                            |
   | Link to Learning Resource    | Link to internal Microsoft Power Platform learning resources, or you can link to aka.ms/PowerUp    |
   |Link to Policy Documentation | Link to internal Microsoft Power Platform policies; for example, a Teams channel or SharePoint site |
   |Version                      | Set to 1.0        |

**To configure CoE settings**

1. For Option 1 (Core Components installed in Production environment)
    1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/), select **Apps**, and then open the **Power Platform Admin View** model-driven app in Play mode.
    1. On the left pane, select **Configure**.
    1. On the **Configure view** screen, select **+ New**.
    1. Provide values as listed in the above table.
    1. Select **Save**.

1. For Option 2 (Core Components installed in Dataverse for Teams environment)
    1. Open to the Power Apps app in Teams, select **Build**, and select the Team you have added the solution to.
    1. Select **Installed apps**.
    1. Select **See all** for Center of Excellence - Core Components.
    1. Select **Tables > COE Settings**.
    1. Select **Edit data**.
    1. Provide values as listed in the above table for each column.
    1. Select **Close**.

You don't need to add more records to the CoE Settings table. Any dependent components will always get values from the first record.

## Set up audit log sync

The Audit Log Sync flow connects to the Microsoft 365 audit log to gather telemetry data (unique users, launches) for apps. The CoE Starter Kit will work without this flow; however, usage information (app launches, unique users) in the Power BI dashboard will be blank. More information: [Set up the audit log connector](setup-auditlog.md)

## Set up the Power BI dashboard

The CoE Power BI dashboard provides a holistic view with visualizations and insights into resources in your tenant: environments, apps, Power Automate flows, connectors, connection references, makers, and audit logs. Telemetry from the audit log is stored from the moment you set up the CoE Starter Kit, so over time you can look back and identify trends for longer than 28 days. More information: [Set up the Power BI dashboard](setup-powerbi.md)

## Share apps with other admins

The core components solution doesn't contain any apps for makers or users, only admin-specific apps. These components are designed to give admins better visibility and overview of resources and usage in their environments. None of the components are to be shared with makers or users.

[Publish and add an app to Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/teams/publish-and-share-apps#publish-and-add-an-app-to-teams)

## Wait for flows to finish

After the sync flows have finished running (depending on the number of environments and resources, this can take a few hours), you're ready to use the core components of the CoE Starter Kit.

**To check the status of a flow**

1. Select **Admin \| Sync Template v3**.

   This will open a new tab to the **Flow detail** page.

1. View **Runs**.

## Update environment variables

>[!IMPORTANT]
> You don't have to complete this step during setup, just when you need to change the value of an environment variable that you configured during import.

Environment variables are used to store application and flow configuration data with data specific to your organization or environment.

1. Go to [flow.microsoft.com](<https://flow.microsoft.com>).
1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.
1. Select the **Default Solution**, and change the filter to show **Environment Variables**.
1. Select a variable that you want to update, and then configure its **Current Value**.

    Update one of the following variables for the core components solution, and then select **Save**.

    | Name | Current Value |
    |------|---------------|
    |Power Automate environment variable | For a US environment: <https://us.flow.microsoft.com/manage/environments/> <br>For an EMEA environment: <https://emea.flow.microsoft.com/manage/environments/> <br>For a GCC environment: <https://gov.flow.microsoft.us/manage/environments/> |
    |Admin eMail                         | Email address used in flows to send notifications to admins; this should be either your email address or a distribution list |
    |eMail Header Style                  | CSS style used to format emails that are sent to admins and makers. A default value is provided. [See the provided default value](code-samples/css/default-value-eMail-Header-Style.md). |
    |Also Delete from CoE | When the Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Check Deleted) flow is run, this denotes whether you want the items deleted from CoE (Yes, which is the default) or just marked as deleted (No). |
    | Full Inventory | Determines if you want to only update objects that have changed, or all objects. Defaults to No. Switching to Yes will cause the flows to inventory every single app, flow, and bot. |
    | Power Platform Maker Office 365 Group | The Admin \| Welcome Email flow sends a welcome email to onboard new makers and adds them to an Office 365 group. You can use this group to send communications to your makers or invite them to a Yammer or Teams group. Configure the group ID here.|
