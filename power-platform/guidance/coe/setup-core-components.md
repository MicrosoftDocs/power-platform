# Set up inventory components

This article helps you set up the inventory components of the **Core** solution of the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit. The inventory is the heart of the CoE. Your Microsoft Power Platform journey is most beneficial when you understand your apps, flows, and makers, and can lay the foundation to monitor new apps and flows being created.

The flows and dataflows in this solution sync all your resources into tables. This solution helps you build admin apps, flows, and dashboards on top of inventory. This setup gives you a holistic overview into the apps, flows, and makers that exist in your environment. Apps like **DLP Editor** and **Set App Permissions** help with daily admin tasks.

## Prerequisites

1. Complete the [Get started](setup.md) article
1. [Set up your environment](setup.md#create-your-environments).
1. Sign in with the [correct identity](setup.md#which-identity-should-i-use-to-install-the-coe-starter-kit).

> [!NOTE]
>
> - If you are trying out [Data Export](setup.md#what-data-source-should-i-use-for-my-power-platform-inventory) for inventory, we recommend you don't depend on this feature just yet and test it in a dedicated test environment first. Trying out this feature helps us validate that the feature is what you need and that we're not introducing unintended side effects.
> - Your feedback is critical to this process. Post your feedback by [raising an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/issues/new?assignees=Jenefer-Monroe&labels=coe-starter-kit%2Cquestion&template=5-coe-starter-kit-question.yml&title=%5BCoE+Starter+Kit+-+QUESTION%5D+QUESTION).
> - Setting up the inventory components using [Data Export](setup.md#what-data-source-should-i-use-for-my-power-platform-inventory) is only supported through the [setup wizard](#set-up-the-inventory-components-using-the-setup-wizard). Manual setup instructions are available after the experimental preview.

## Import the Creator Kit and make connections

### Import Creator Kit

The CoE Starter Kit requires the installation of the [Creator Kit](../creator-kit/overview.md) in the environment where you installed the CoE Starter Kit.

[Install the Creator Kit](../creator-kit/setup.md) before proceeding.

### Create connections

Create these connections manually ahead of installing the kit to ensure they're correctly configured.

1. Go to [Power Automate](https://make.powerautomate.com/).
1. Select your CoE environment and go to **Data** > **Connections** > **+ New connection**.
1. Create a connection for [HTTP with Microsoft Entra ID (preauthorized)](/connectors/webcontents/), and set **Base Resource URL** and **Microsoft Entra ID Resource URI (Application ID URI)** to [https://graph.microsoft.com/](https://graph.microsoft.com/) for commercial tenants. If your tenant is in GCC, GCC High, or DoD, check your [service root endpoint for Microsoft Graph](/graph/deployments#microsoft-graph-and-graph-explorer-service-root-endpoints).

   :::image type="content" source="media/httpazuread.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the HTTP with Microsoft Entra ID connection window." lightbox="media/httpazuread.png":::

### Import the core components solution

1. Download the CoE Starter Kit [compressed file](https://aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload) to your computer.

1. Extract the compressed zip file. The CoE Starter Kit compressed file contains all solution components in addition to the non–solution-aware components that make up the CoE Starter Kit.

1. Import the **CenterOfExcellenceCoreComponents_x_x_x_xx_managed.zip** solution file from the extracted folder.

1. For an environment in the commercial cloud, leave all environment variable values blank. For a GCC, GCC High, and DoD environment, check [Microsoft Graph and Graph Explorer service root endpoints](/graph/deployments#microsoft-graph-and-graph-explorer-service-root-endpoints) and enter the value for your cloud in the **Graph URL Environment Variable** environment variable.

The import can take up to an hour to be complete, and upgrades can take up to two hours.

> [!NOTE]
> After importing your solution, you might see this warning: *Solution "Center of Excellence - Core components" imported successfully with warnings: Flow client error returned with status code Bad Request*. This warning message can be ignored, and you can proceed with opening the **Setup Wizard** app to continue the setup and configuration of the solution.

## Set up the Inventory components using the Setup Wizard

### Open the Setup Wizard to complete the configuration

1. After the solution import is successful, open the **Center of Excellence - Core Components** solution.
1. Open the **CoE Setup and Upgrade Wizard** app.
1. This app guides you through the configuration steps.
   :::image type="content" source="media\coesetupwizard.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the CoE Setup Wizard." lightbox="media\coesetupwizard.png":::

#### Troubleshooting

If you see an *Error Loading Control* warning when opening the Setup Wizard app, it means some of the flows required to run the wizard couldn't be turned on automatically. Navigate to the solution and turn on the following flows manually:

- SetupWizard > GetCurrentEnvironment
- SetupWizard > GetTenantID
- SetupWizard > GetUserDetails

Once turned on, you can return to the Setup Wizard to continue the setup.

### Choose data source

You can choose your data source for inventory. **Cloud flows** is the default and currently recommended path for gathering your inventory.

However, you might wish to experiment with the **Data Export (Preview)** data source. To experiment, use the [Data Export setup](setup-dataexport.md) instructions when you get to the **Configure dataflows** page.

:::image type="content" source="media\setupWizard-datasource.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Setup Wizard data source selection." lightbox="media\setupWizard-datasource.png":::

## Set up the CoE Admin Command Center app

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Only complete these steps if you want to review Power Platform–related [Microsoft 365 Message Center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/message-center) updates in the **[CoE Admin Command Center](core-components.md#coe-admin-command-center)** canvas app. The **CoE Admin Command Center** app can be used without this configuration.

### Create a Microsoft Entra app registration to connect to Microsoft Graph

The [CoE Admin Command Center](core-components.md#coe-admin-command-center) connects to [Microsoft Graph API](/graph/api/serviceannouncement-list-messages) to get [Microsoft 365 Message Center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/message-center) updates.

Using these steps, you set up the Entra app registration used in a cloud flow to connect to the Graph API. For more information, see [Use the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/use-the-api).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Go to **Microsoft Entra ID** > **App registrations**.
   :::image type="content" source="media/coe33.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Entra app registration." lightbox="media/coe33.png":::
1. Select **+ New Registration**.
1. Enter a name. For example, use the **CoE Command Center** name. Don't change any other settings and select **Register**.
1. Select **API Permissions** > **+ Add a permission**.
   :::image type="content" source="media\coe34.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows API permissions." lightbox="media\coe34.png":::
1. Select **Microsoft Graph** and configure permissions as follows:
   1. Select **Application permissions**, and then select **ServiceMessage.Read.All**.
   1. Select **Add permissions**.
1. Select **Grant Admin Consent for (your organization)**.
1. Select **Certificates and secrets**.
1. Select **+ New client secret**.
1. Add a description and expiration (in line with your organization's policies), and then select **Add**.
1. Copy and paste the **Secret** to a text document such as Notepad.
1. Select **Overview** and copy and paste the application (client) ID value to the same text document. Be sure to make a note of which GUID is for which value.

### Update environment variables

[Update the environment variables](faq.md#update-environment-variables) that hold the client ID and secret, as shown in the following table.

You can store the client secret either in plain text in the **Command Center - Client Secret** environment variable (not recommended) or store the client secret in Azure Key Vault and reference it in the **Command Center - Client Azure Secret** environment variable (recommended). Review the required permissions to [use Azure Key Vault secrets in environment variables](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/environmentvariables#use-azure-key-vault-secrets-preview).

> [!NOTE]
> The flow using this environment variable is configured with a condition to expect either the Command Center - Client Secret or the Command Center - Client Azure Secret environment variable. You don't need to edit the flow or command center application to work with Azure Key Vault.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Command Center - Application Client ID | The application client ID from the [Create a Microsoft Entra app registration to connect to Microsoft Graph](#create-a-microsoft-entra-app-registration-to-connect-to-microsoft-graph) step. |
| Command Center - Client Secret | The application client secret from the [Create a Microsoft Entra app registration to connect to Microsoft Graph](#create-a-microsoft-entra-app-registration-to-connect-to-microsoft-graph) step. Leave empty if you're using Azure Key Vault to store your client ID and secret. |
| Command Center - Client Azure Secret | The Azure Key Vault reference for the application client secret from the [Create a Microsoft Entra app registration to connect to Microsoft Graph](#create-a-microsoft-entra-app-registration-to-connect-to-microsoft-graph) step. Leave empty if you're storing your client ID in plain text in the Command Center - Client Secret environment variable. This variable expects the Azure Key Vault reference, not the secret. For more information, see [Use Azure Key Vault secrets in environment variables](/powerapps/maker/data-platform/environmentvariables#use-azure-key-vault-secrets-preview). |

### Modify the Command Center app & get Microsoft 365 service messages flow for a GCC High or DoD tenant

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your CoE Starter Kit is installed in a *commercial* or *GCC* tenant, you can skip this step.

If your CoE Starter Kit is installed in a *GCC High* or *DoD* tenant, update the **Authority** in HTTP action:

1. Go to [make.powerautomate.com](https://make.powerautomate.com), select **Solutions**, and then open the **Center of Excellence - Core Components** solution to view the flows.
1. Edit the **Command Center App > Get M365 Service Messages** flow.
1. Update the **List serviceAnnouncements from Graph** action and change the **Authority** to [https://login.microsoftonline.us/](https://login.microsoftonline.us/) for a GCC High or DoD tenant.
1. **Save** this flow.

## Set up Audit Logs solution

> [!NOTE]
> Only set up the Audit Log solution if you chose [cloud flows](setup.md#what-data-source-should-i-use-for-my-power-platform-inventory) as the mechanism for inventory and telemetry.

The Audit Log Sync flow connects to the Microsoft 365 audit log to gather telemetry data (unique users and launches) for apps. The CoE Starter Kit works without this flow. However, usage information, such as app launches and unique users, in the Power BI dashboard is blank. For more information, see [Set up the audit log](setup-auditlog-http.md).

## Set up the Power BI dashboard

The CoE Power BI dashboard provides a holistic view with visualizations and insights into resources in your tenant: environments, apps, Power Automate flows, connectors, connection references, makers, and audit logs. Telemetry from the audit log is stored from the moment you set up the CoE Starter Kit. Over time, you can identify trends longer than 28 days. For more information, see [Set up the Power BI dashboard](setup-powerbi.md).

## Share apps with other admins

The core components solution contains apps designed to give admins better visibility and overview of resources and usage in their environments.

Share these apps with other Power Platform admins and assign them the **Power Platform Admin SR** security role:

- [CoE Admin Command Center](core-components.md#coe-admin-command-center)
- [Power Platform Admin View](core-components.md#power-platform-admin-view)

Take a look at the [CoE Admin Command Center](core-components.md#coe-admin-command-center) app, which is your central place to open all CoE Starter Kit apps.

For more information, see [Share a canvas app in Power Apps](faq.md#share-an-app-from-a-production-environment).

## Wait for flows to finish

After the sync flows finish running, you're ready to use many of the features of the CoE Starter Kit core solution.  

The first run of the inventory can take many hours depending on the number of environments and resources in your tenants. Future runs are faster, because they look at new and modified resources.

### To check the status of a flow

1. Select **Admin** > **Sync Template v4 (Driver)**.

   You see a new tab open to the **Flow detail** page.

1. View **Runs**.

- Check out [other components part of the core solution](core-components.md#environment-request-management-components), and the [governance](governance-components.md) and [nurture](nurture-components.md) solutions.

## All environment variables

This section includes the full list of environment variables that affect the inventory sync flows, including environment variables with default values. You might need to [update environment variables](faq.md#update-environment-variables) after you import.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You don't have to change the values during setup. However, you can change an environment variable that you configured during import or when you want to change a default value. To make sure the latest values are picked up, restart all flows after you change environment variables.

Environment variables are used to store application and flow configuration data with data specific to your organization or environment.
