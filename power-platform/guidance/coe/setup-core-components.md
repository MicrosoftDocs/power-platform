# Set up core components

[!INCLUDE[cc-data-platform-banner](../../includes/cc-data-platform-banner.md)]

The Center of Excellence (CoE) core components solution provides components that you need to get started with setting up a CoE. They sync all your resources into tables and build admin apps on top of that to help you get more visibility into the apps, flows, and makers that exist in your environment. Additionally, apps like DLP Editor and Set App Permissions help with daily admin tasks.  

The core components solution contains assets that are only relevant to admins.

[Watch how to setup](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z9Vp2IxFzpU) the core components solution.

## Import the solution

The Core Components can be used in both Production environments and Dataverse for Teams environments. Where you install it will depend on your organization setup, your adoption of Microsoft Power Platform so far and what you want to achieve with the CoE Starter Kit. Before you decide, compare [Dataverse vs Dataverse for Teams](/powerapps/teams/data-platform-compare)

Learn more: [What is Dataverse for Teams](/powerapps/teams/overview-data-platform)

### Option 1: Import the solution into a Production environment

This is the first step of the installation process and is required for every other component in the starter kit to work. You'll need to create an environment in which to set up the CoE. For more information about how to decide on the best strategy for your organization, go to [Establishing an Environment Strategy for Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/guidance/adoption/environment-strategy) and [Environment strategy for ALM](/power-platform/alm/environment-strategy-alm).

1. Download the CoE Starter Kit compressed file ([aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload](https://aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload)).

    >[!IMPORTANT]
    > **Extract the zip file** after downloading and before moving on to the next step. The CoE Starter Kit compressed file contains all solution components as well as non-solution aware components that make up the CoE Starter Kit.

1. Create an environment in which to set up the CoE.

   1. Go to the [Power Platform admin center](https://admin.powerplatform.microsoft.com/).
   1. Select **Environments** > **+ New**, and then enter a name, type, and purpose.
   1. Select **Yes** for creating the database, and then select **Next**.
   1. Leave **Sample apps and data** set to **No**
   1. Select **Save**.

1. Go to your new environment.

    1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](<https://make.powerapps.com>).
    1. Go to the environment you just created, in which the CoE solution will be hosted. In the example in the following screenshot, we're importing to the environment named **Contoso CoE**.

     ![Power Apps maker portal environment selection.](media/coe6.png "Power Apps maker portal environment selection")

1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.

1. Select **Import**, and then **Browse**.

1. Select the Center of Excellence core components solution from File Explorer (CenterOfExcellenceCoreComponents_*x_x_x_xx*_managed.zip).

1. When the compressed (.zip) file has been loaded, select **Next**.

1. Review the information, and then select **Next**.
1. Establish connections to activate your solution. If you create a new connection, you must select **Refresh**. You won't lose your import progress.

     ![Establish connections to activate your solution.](media/msi-import.png "Establish connections to activate your solution.")

    When you create the connection for HTTP with Azure AD enter the following into the Base Resource URL and Azure AD Resource URI (Application ID URI): [https://graph.microsoft.com](https://graph.microsoft.com) or [https://dod-graph.microsoft.us/](https://dod-graph.microsoft.us/) if you're in a DoD environment.

     ![Establish HTTP with Azure AD.](media/httpazuread.png "Establish connections to activate your solution.")

1. Update environment variable values. The environment variables are used to store application and flow configuration data with data specific to your organization or environment. This means that you only have to set the value once per environment and it will be used in all necessary flows and apps in that environment. All the flows in the solution depend on all environment variables' being configured.

    ![Update environment variable values.](media/msi-envvar.png "Update environment variable values")

    Configure the following variables for the core components solution, and then select **Save**. (If you need to change the value of an environment variable after you import the solution, go to [Update environment variables](#update-environment-variables).)

1. Select **Import**.

The import can take up to 60 minutes to be completed. Learn more about the apps and flows in the Core components: [What's in the Core Components](core-components.md)

## Update and turn on child flows

There are several child flows which will need their **Run only users** properties updated.

- HELPER - CloudFlowOperations
- HELPER - CanvasAppOperations
- HELPER - ObjectOperations
- CLEANUP HELPER - Check Deleted (Canvas Apps)
- CLEANUP HELPER - Check Deleted (Cloud Flows)
- CLEANUP HELPER - Check Deleted (Model Driven Apps)
- CLEANUP HELPER - Check Deleted (PVA)
- CLEANUP HELPER - Check Deleted (Custom Connectors)
- CLEANUP HELPER - Power Apps User Shared With

First, [remove the unmanaged layer](setup.md#installing-updates) for all flows. Then, go to the details page and click the **Run only users** edit button.

 ![Find setting for run only users.](media/runonlyusersgov1.png "Find setting for run only users")

You will see all the connections in the child flow. For each one, change the value to **Use this connection (userPrincipalName\@company.com)**. If there is no connection for any of the connectors, go to **Data** > **Connections**, and create one for the connector.
  
![Configure run only users.](media/runonlyusersgov2.png "Configure run only users")

Once you have updated the run only users, turn on all the child flows.

## Activate the flows

The Admin \| Sync Template flows part of this solution crawl through all the resources stored in Microsoft Power Platform and make a copy of details in each resource (for example, apps and flows) to Dataverse (table definitions are provided in this solution). All data displayed in most of the starter kit components must be in Dataverse, which means that the sync template must be configured for everything else to work. The sync flows run daily overnight.

When you first set up the CoE Starter Kit, enable these flows in a specific order which will start the process of crawling and storing the information in Dataverse. Depending on the size of your tenant, the first run of may take long to complete. See the [limitations information](limitations.md) for more details.

1. Wait until it finishes before you turn on any other flows.
1. Turn on: Admin \| Sync Template V3 (Connectors)
1. Wait until it finishes before you turn on any other flows.
1. Turn on the Admin \| Sync Template flows for the following object types: Apps, Custom Connectors, Desktop Flows, Flows, Model Driven Apps, and PVA
1. Turn on Admin \| Sync Template v3.
1. Wait for Admin \| Sync Template v3 to complete its run and then turn it back off. This will avoid write conflicts for large organizations.
1. Check the Admin \| Sync Template flows for apps, flows and other resources and wait until all of these complete.
1. Turn back on Admin \| Sync Template v3.

>[!IMPORTANT]
> Note that **Admin \| Compliance request** flows will not pass until you complete setup of the Governance component so you should leave it turned off until then.

## (Optional) Create an Azure AD app registration to connect to Microsoft Graph

>[!NOTE]
> Only complete this steps if you want to review Power Platform related [Microsoft 365 Message Center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/message-center) updates in the [Admin - Command Center](core-components.md#admin---command-center) canvas app.

The [Admin - Command Center](core-components.md#admin---command-center) connects to [Microsoft Graph API](/graph/api/serviceannouncement-list-messages) to get [Microsoft 365 Message Center](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/message-center) updates.

Using these steps, you'll set up an Azure AD app registration that will be used in a cloud flow to connect to the Graph API. More information: [Use the Microsoft Graph API](/graph/use-the-api)

1. Sign in to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.

   ![Azure AD app registration.](media/coe33.png "Azure AD app registration")

1. Select **+ New Registration**.

1. Enter a name (for example, **CoE Command Center**), don't change any other setting, and then select **Register**.

1. Select **API Permissions** > **+ Add a permission**.

   ![API Permissions - Add a permission.](media/coe34.png "Add a permission")

1. Select **Microsoft Graph**, and configure permissions as follows:

   1. Select **Delegated permissions**, and then select **ServiceMessage.Read.All**.
   1. Select **Application permissions**, and then select **ServiceMessage.Read.All**.
   1. Select **Add permissions**.

1. Select **Grant Admin Consent for (your organization)**.

1. Select **Certificates and secrets**.

1. Select **+ New client secret**.

   ![New client secret.](media/coe39.png "New client secret")

1. Add a description and expiration (in line with your organization's policies), and then select **Add**.

1. Copy and paste the **Secret** to a text document in Notepad for the time being.

1. Select **Overview**, and copy and paste the application (client) ID value to the same text document; be sure to make a note of which GUID is for which value. You'll need these values in the next step as you configure the custom connector.

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com/), select **Solutions**, and then open the **Center of Excellence - Core Components** solution to view the flows.

1. Edit the **Command Center App >  Get M365 Service Messages** flow.

1. Update the **List serviceAnnouncements from Graph** with your client ID and client secret.
    ![Update HTTP action with client ID and secret](media/commandcenter3.png "Update HTTP action with client ID and secret")

    >[!NOTE]
    > Store the client ID and secret in Azure Key Vault and modify the flow to use the [Azure Key Vault connector](/connectors/keyvault/) to retrieve them.

1. **Save** this flow.

## Set up Audit Logs solution

The Audit Log Sync flow connects to the Microsoft 365 audit log to gather telemetry data (unique users, launches) for apps. The CoE Starter Kit will work without this flow; however, usage information (app launches, unique users) in the Power BI dashboard will be blank. More information: [Set up the audit log connector](setup-auditlog.md)

## Set up the Power BI dashboard

The CoE Power BI dashboard provides a holistic view with visualizations and insights into resources in your tenant: environments, apps, Power Automate flows, connectors, connection references, makers, and audit logs. Telemetry from the audit log is stored from the moment you set up the CoE Starter Kit, so over time you can look back and identify trends for longer than 28 days. More information: [Set up the Power BI dashboard](setup-powerbi.md)

## Share apps with other admins

The core components solution contains apps designed to give admins better visibility and overview of resources and usage in their environments. Share those apps with other Power Platform admins. Take a look at the [Admin - Command Center](core-components.md#admin---command-center) app which is your central place to launch all CoE Starter Kit apps from.

More information:

[Share a canvas app in Power Apps](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/share-app)<br>
[Publish and add an app to Teams](/powerapps/teams/publish-and-share-apps#publish-and-add-an-app-to-teams)

## Wait for flows to finish

After the sync flows have finished running (depending on the number of environments and resources, this can take a few hours), you're ready to use the core components of the CoE Starter Kit.

**To check the status of a flow**

1. Select **Admin \| Sync Template v3**.

   This will open a new tab to the **Flow detail** page.

1. View **Runs**.
