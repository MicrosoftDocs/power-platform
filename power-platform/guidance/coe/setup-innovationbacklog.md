# Set up Innovation Backlog components

Use the Innovation Backlog app to ask users to submit ideas for apps and flows that need building, and describe pain points with the current process. As users describe the process, they will provide information about personas involved, tools used, and measures for improvement. This information is then used to calculate an ROI and complexity score.

Pick the most impactful ideas for your development team to build, or select them for an upcoming hackathon. Other users can vote on ideas, or add their own scenarios to an existing idea. Developers can additionally request feedback and testimonials to build their portfolio.

The Innovation Backlog solution contains assets that are relevant to all users in your organization, and can be installed in [production](../../admin/environments-overview.md#types-of-environments) or [Dataverse for Teams](/powerapps/teams/overview-data-platform) environments.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Innovation Backlog components solution doesn't have a dependency on other components of the CoE Starter Kit. It can be used independently.

## Option 1: Import the solution into a production environment

Before you begin, review the [prerequisites](setup.md) for using the starter kit solution.

- If you aren't already using the CoE Starter Kit, we recommend [creating a new environment](../../admin/create-environment.md) for CoE solutions.
- If you are already using other CoE Starter Kit components, use the environment that you created as part of setting up the [core components](setup-core-components.md) for this solution.

1. Download the CoE Starter Kit compressed file from [aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload](https://aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload).

1. Extract the zip file.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](<https://make.powerapps.com>).

1. Select your CoE environment. In the example, we're importing to the environment named **Contoso CoE**.

     ![Power Apps maker portal environment selection.](media/coe6.png "Power Apps maker portal environment selection")

1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.

1. Select **Import**. A pop-up window appears. (If the window doesn't appear, ensure that your browser's pop-up blocker is disabled and try again.)

1. In the pop-up window, select **Choose File**.

1. Select the Center Of Excellence Innovation Backlog solution: CenterOfExcellenceInnovationBacklog_*x_x_x_xx*_managed.zip.

1. When the compressed (.zip) file has been loaded, select **Next**.

1. Establish connections to the Microsoft Dataverse (Current Environment), Microsoft Dataverse, Power Apps for Makers, and Power Platform for Admins connector. If you create a new connection, you must select **Refresh**. You won't lose your import progress.

     ![Establish connections to activate your solution.](media/ibteams-2.png "Establish connections to activate your solution.")

1. Leave the Environment Variables blank and select **Next**. 

     ![Leave environment variables blank.](media/ibteams-3.png "Leave environment variables blank.")

1. Select **Import**. (This might take some time.)

1. When the import succeeds, refresh the page and open the Center of Excellence - Innovation Backlog solution.

### Turn on the flows

To populate some of the tables with default values, turn on the following flows:

- Add pain points
- Update Software Tools

Learn more: [Turn flows on](/power-automate/disable-flow#turn-flows-on)

1. Now, run the flows to populate some of the tables with default values.

    1. Open the **Add pain points** cloud flow and select **Run** > **Run Flow**.

       ![Run Add pain points cloud flow.](media/ib-2.png "Run Add pain points cloud flow")
    
    1. Open the **Update Software Tools** cloud flow and select **Run** > **Run Flow**.

        ![Run Update Software Tools cloud flow.](media/ib-3.png "Run Update Software Tools cloud flow")
    
    1. Wait for both of them to finish. (This might take 10 minutes.)

1. Extract **ToolIcons.zip**. You can find this file in the initial download.

1. Open the **Innovation Backlog Admin** app.

    ![Open the Innovation Backlog Admin app.](media/ib-4.png "Open the Innovation Backlog Admin app")

1. Select **Go Icon**.

    ![Select Go Icon to update icons.](media/ib-5.png "Select Go Icons to update icons")

1. Select each non-software tool, add an icon from the **ToolIcons** folder, and select **Add** to save the icon.

   ![Add an icon for a non-software tool in the Admin app.](media/ib-10.png "Add an icon for a non-software tool in the Admin app")

1. Go back to the Center of Excellence - Innovation Backlog solution and select the **Innovation Backlog** canvas app.

   ![Open the Innovation Backlog app.](media/ib-6.png "Open the Innovation Backlog app")

1. Copy the **Web Link**.

   ![Copy the Web Link.](media/ib-9.png "Copy the Web Link")

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](<https://make.powerapps.com>) > **Solutions** > **Default Solution** and filter by **Environment Variables**.

   ![Open the Default Solution and filter to only show Environment Variables.](media/ib-7.png "Open the Default Solution and filter to only show Environment Variables")

1. Select the **InnovationBacklogAppURL** variable and paste in the URL for the Innovation Backlog app.

   ![Update the InnovationBacklogAppURL environment variable.](media/ib-8.png "Update the InnovationBacklogAppURL environment variable")

You can now [use the Innovation Backlog app](innovationbacklog-components.md).

## Option 2: Import the solution into a Dataverse for Teams environment

Before you begin:

- Decide which team to add the Innovation Backlog app to or create a new team.
- [Install the Power Apps app](/powerapps/teams/install-personal-app) in Teams.
- [Create your first app](/powerapps/teams/create-first-app) (at least one app is required in the environment to enable the solution import experience).

1. Download the CoE Starter Kit compressed file from [aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload](https://aka.ms/CoeStarterKitDownload).

1. Extract the .zip file.

1. Open to the Power Apps app in Teams, select **Build**, and select the Team you want to add the solution to.

1. Select **See All**.

    ![Open the Power Apps app in Teams to import a new solution.](media/ibteams-1.png "Open the Power Apps app in Teams to import a new solution.")

1. Select **Import**.

1. In the pop-up window, select **Choose File**.

1. Select the Center Of Excellence Innovation Backlog solution: CenterOfExcellenceInnovationBacklog_*x_x_x_xx*_managed.zip.

1. When the compressed (.zip) file has been loaded, select **Next**.
