# Feedback and support

Although the underlying features and components used to build the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit (such as Microsoft Dataverse, admin APIs, and connectors) are fully supported, the kit itself represents sample implementations of these features. Our customers and community can use and customize these features to implement admin and governance capabilities in their organizations.

If you face issues with:

- **Using the kit**: Report your issue here: [aka.ms/coe-starter-kit-issues](https://github.com/microsoft/powerapps-tools/issues/new?assignees=JeneferM-MSFT&labels=coestarterkit&template=-coe-starter-kit-app--bug-report.md&title=%5BBUG%5D%3A+issue+title). (Microsoft Support won't help you with issues related to this kit, but they will help with related, underlying platform and feature issues.)
- **The core features in Microsoft Power Platform**: Use your standard channel to contact Microsoft Support.
