# Use governance components

After you become familiar with your environments and resources, think about governance processes for your apps. You might want to gather extra information about your apps from your makers, or audit specific connectors or app usage.

[Watch an overview](https://www.youtube.com/embed/6bfaFsFtLow) of how to use the Governance components solution.

The Governance components solution contains assets relevant to admins and makers. Learn more in [Set up Developer Compliance components](setup-governance-components.md).

## Compliance processes

[Watch a walk-through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WXXFjHLt5ss&list=PLi9EhCY4z99W5kzaPK1np6sv6AzMQDsXG) of how the compliance process works.

### Flows

>[!NOTE]
>These flows are part of the Core components solution; however, most of their functionality is implemented in the Governance components solution.

| Flow | Type | Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Admin \| Compliance request complete apps v3 | Automated |  Triggered when the [Power Apps Approval BPF](#power-apps-app-approval-bpf) is marked complete. |
| Admin \| Compliance request complete bots v3 | Automated |  Triggered when the [Chatbot Approval BPF](#chatbot-approval-bpf) is marked complete. |
| Admin \| Compliance request complete custom connector v3 | Automated |  Triggered when the [Custom Connector Approval BPF](#custom-connector-approval-bpf) is marked complete. |
| Admin \| Compliance request complete flow v3 | Automated |  Triggered when the [Flow Approval BPF](#flow-approval-bpf) is marked complete. |
| Admin \| Compliance Teams Environment BPF kickoff v3 | Automated |  Triggered when a business justification is submitted for a Microsoft Teams environment. |
| [Admin \| Compliance Detail request v3](#admin-compliance-detail-request-v3) | Scheduled | Facilitates the process described in [App auditing process](example-processes.md). |

#### Admin Compliance Detail request v3

This flow works with other apps and flows in the Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit to facilitate the process described in [App auditing process](example-processes.md). It sends compliance detail request emails for apps and chatbots.

This flow sends an email to users who have apps in the tenant that aren't compliant with the following thresholds:

- The app is shared with more than 20 users or at least one group, and no business justification details are provided for it.

- The app has business justification details, but isn't published in 60 days (so it's likely not on the latest version of Power Apps) or is missing a description.

- The app has business justification details and an indication of high business impact, but no mitigation plan is submitted to the attachments field.

This flow sends an email to users who have chatbots in the tenant that aren't compliant with the following thresholds:

- The chatbot is launched more than 50 times, and no business justification details are provided for it.

- The chatbot has business justification details and an indication of high business impact, but no mitigation plan is submitted to the attachments field.

You can customize the criteria for when makers are asked to provide a business justification by using [Update environment variables](faq.md#update-environment-variables). Default values are provided.

You can customize the email that the flow sends out. By default, it looks like the following image:

![The compliance detail request email informs a maker that they own an app that is currently missing compliance details, which means it needs to be audited by an admin per the support policy. Makers are prompted to complete the business justification and mitigation plan details in the Developer Compliance Center app to document the intended use of the app.](media/coe55.png "The compliance detail request email informs a maker that they own an app that is currently missing compliance details, which means it needs to be audited by an admin per the support policy. Makers are prompted to complete the business justification and mitigation plan details in the Developer Compliance Center app to document the intended use of the app.")

### Apps

The Governance components solution includes several apps that support compliance and governance processes. These apps enable makers to submit business justifications, view compliance status, and help administrators manage governance workflows effectively.

#### Developer Compliance Center

Use this app in the [App auditing process](example-processes.md) to check whether you comply with app compliance requirements for apps, flows, chatbots, or custom connectors you own. Use it to submit information to the CoE admins as business justification to stay in compliance.

**Permission**: Share this app with your app makers as soon as you're using the app auditing process. If you intend to use this process, modify the [Set up nurture components](setup-nurture-components.md) flow to add users to a security group, then share this app with the security group.

**Prerequisite**: This app uses Microsoft Dataverse. If you install this solution in a production environment, end users need to have a Per User license, or the app needs to be assigned a Per App license, or the environment needs to be covered by pay-as-you-go.

#### Compliance status

The Developer Compliance Center enables makers to check the compliance status and submit more details for the following resources:

- Canvas apps
- Model-driven apps
- Flows
- Bots
- Custom connectors
- Desktop Flows
- Solutions
- Environments

Based on the resource, makers can filter their resources to the following compliance status:

- **Missing Details** indicates that the compliance process or an admin requests more details to bring the resource back into compliance.
- **Flagged as inactive** indicates that the resource is marked as inactive.
- **Non-compliant** indicates that the resource is currently noncompliant with existing DLP or billing policies; often this status means that the resource can't be used until the problem is resolved.
- **Re-publish needed** (for canvas apps only) indicates that the app wasn't published in the past 60 days.
- **Missing description** indicates that the resource needs a description populated to help the admin understand what the resource is used for.

:::image type="content" source="media/coe56.png" alt-text="Developer Compliance Center overview":::

For **Missing Details**, makers can achieve compliance by providing additional information through the **Support Details** form:

- **Business Justification**: Describe the business need and the problem you're solving with this solution.
- **Business Impact**: Define the operational impact this solution has on the people using it.
- **Access Management**: Describe who has access to this resource, how access is managed (individual user access or access through group membership), and how joiners/movers/leavers processes are managed.
- **Dependencies**: Describe any dependencies this solution usesâ€”for example, external or internal APIs or Azure resources.
- **Conditions of use**: (For connectors only) Describe in which situations the connector can and should be used.
- **Mitigation Plan provided**: For critical solutions, upload a mitigation plan that details what business users do if there isn't an outage.

**Customize**: Verify that the **Support details** form matches your requirements, and update it if necessary.

### Business process flows (BPFs)

Business process flows provide structured guidance for administrators during governance and approval processes. These flows visualize the approval stages and help ensure consistent review procedures for different types of Power Platform resources.

#### Power Apps App Approval BPF

This process helps the admin audit the app approval process by providing a visualization of the stage in the process they're currently on. The audit stages are:

- Validate maker requirements.
- Assess risk.
- Highlight the app in the app catalog.

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      ![Power Apps App Approval BPF - Implementation.](media/coe62.png "Power Apps App Approval BPF - Implementation")
   :::column-end:::
   :::column span="":::
      ![Power Apps App Approval BPF - Validate Maker Requirements.](media/coe63.png "Power Apps App Approval BPF - Validate Maker Requirements")
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

#### Flow Approval BPF

This process helps the admin audit the flow approval process by providing a visualization of the stage in the process they're currently on. The audit stages are:

- Validate maker requirements.
- Assess risk.
- Complete the admin review.

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      ![Flow Approval BPF - Implementation.](media/bpf1.png "Flow Approval BPF - Implementation")

   :::column span="":::
      ![Flow Approval BPF - Validate Maker Requirements.](media/bpf2.png "Flow Approval BPF - Validate Maker Requirements")
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

#### Custom Connector Approval BPF

This process helps the admin audit the custom connector approval process by providing a visualization of the stage in the process they're currently on. The audit stages are:

- Validate maker requirements.
- Assess risk.
- Complete the admin review.

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      ![Custom Connector Approval BPF - Implementation.](media/bpf5.png "Custom Connector Approval BPF - Implementation")

   :::column span="":::
      ![Custom Connector Approval BPF - Validate Maker Requirements.](media/bpf4.png "Custom Connector Approval BPF - Validate Maker Requirements")
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

#### Chatbot Approval BPF

This process helps the admin audit the chatbot approval process by providing a visualization of the stage in the process they're currently on. The audit stages are:

- Validate maker requirements.
- Assess risk.
- Complete the admin review.

:::row:::
   :::column span="":::
      ![Chatbot Approval BPF - Implementation.](media/bpf7.png "Chatbot Approval BPF - Implementation")

   :::column span="":::
      ![Chatbot Approval BPF - Validate Maker Requirements.](media/bpf6.png "Chatbot Approval BPF - Validate Maker Requirements")
   :::column-end:::
:::row-end:::

#### Activate the business process flows

All business process flows are disabled by default. To enable them, follow these steps:

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](<https://make.powerapps.com>) and set the current environment to the same environment where you installed the CoE solution.

1. Select **Solutions** > **Center of Excellence**.

1. Select **Process** from the filter option at the top.

1. In **Power Apps App Approval BPF**, select the ellipsis (...), then select **Turn On**.

1. Repeat the previous step for **Flow Approval BPF**, **Custom Connector Approval BPF**, and **Chatbot Approval BPF**.

## Inactivity processes

[Watch a walk-through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ5u_2E9uUI&list=PLi9EhCY4z99W5kzaPK1np6sv6AzMQDsXG) of how the inactivity process works.

### Tables

The inactivity processes use custom Dataverse tables to track and manage approval workflows for inactive resources.

#### Inactivity notifications approval

Represents inactivity notifications approval tasks that start during the **Admin | Inactivity notifications v2** flows.

### Flows

| Flow | Type | Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Admin \| Inactivity notifications v2 (Start Approval for Apps)](#admin--inactivity-notifications-v2-start-approval-for-apps) | Schedule | Weekly |
| [Admin \| Inactivity notifications v2 (Start Approval for Flows)](#admin--inactivity-notifications-v2-start-approval-for-flows) | Schedule | Weekly |
| [Admin \| Inactivity notifications v2 (Check Approval)](#admin--inactivity-notifications-check-approval) | Schedule | Daily |
| [Admin \| Inactivity notifications v2 (Clean Up and Delete)](#admin--inactivity-notifications-clean-up-and-delete) | Schedule | Daily |
| [Admin \| Email Managers Ignored Approvals](#admin--email-managers-ignored-inactivity-notifications-approvals) | Instant | Weekly |

#### Admin \| Inactivity notifications v2 (Start Approval for Apps)

Checks for apps that you didn't modify or launch in the last six months (you can configure this time span) and asks the app owner (via flow approvals) whether they can delete the app.

It recommends that the app owner backs up the app if they want to restore it later.

This flow starts the approval process and writes the approval task to the Archive Approval Dataverse table.

**Customize**: By default, this flow assigns approvals to the app owner. To test in a debug environment without involving users, update the [All environment variables](setup-governance-components.md#all-environment-variables) to **No**. The admin account then receives the approvals.

![Inactivity notifications v2 - workflow for Apps.](media/archivalFlow-Apps.png "Inactivity notifications v2 - workflow for Apps")

#### Admin \| Inactivity notifications v2 (Start Approval for Flows)

Similar to the previous flow, but for flows rather than apps. This flow checks for flows that you didn't modify in the last six months (you can configure this time span) and asks the flow owner (via flow approvals) whether they can delete the flow.

It recommends that the flow owner backs up the app if they want to restore it later.

This flow starts the approval process and writes the approval task to the Archive Approval Dataverse table.

**Customize**: By default, this flow assigns approvals to the flow owner. To test in a debug environment without involving users, update the [All environment variables](setup-governance-components.md#all-environment-variables) to **No**. The admin account then receives the approvals.

![Inactivity notifications - workflow for Flows.](media/archivalFlow-Flows.png "Inactivity notifications v2 - workflow for Flows")

#### Admin \| Inactivity notifications (Check Approval)

On a scheduled interval, checks for approval responses created by the Start Approval flows described above. If the response is newly approved, marks the approved date so that the Inactivity notifications v2 (Clean Up and Delete) flow (described below) can delete it after the user has time to archive.

If the response was approved in the past but before deletion, sends a reminder to archive the app or flow before deletion.

#### Admin \| Inactivity notifications (Clean Up and Delete)

Runs daily and does two cleanup tasks for the workflow.

1. Deletes the flows and apps that you approved for deletion more than three weeks ago (you can configure this time span).
1. Deletes expired approval requests that you created over a month ago. If a maker ignores an approval request, their app or flow isn't deleted. However, they receive another approval request again in the future. Additionally, their manager receives a notification on ignored requests.

#### Admin \| Email Managers Ignored Inactivity notifications Approvals

Works with the other Inactivity notifications flows. It looks for approvals from this system that makers ignored for one month or more and sends their manager a list of these, asking they help by encouraging their employees to approve or reject the request.

![Mail sent to managers.](media/ArchiveApps1.png "Mail sent to managers")

### Apps

The inactivity processes include management applications that help administrators and managers handle cleanup tasks and review objects marked for archival or deletion.

#### Cleanup Old Objects App

This app sends an email to managers when makers don't respond to requests about whether objects are still useful, as described in the archival flows.

![Mail sent to managers.](media/ArchiveApps1.png "Mail sent to managers")

The manager can select the link in the mail and go to this app for cleaning.

They can choose which employee to work on first.

![Select user screen.](media/ArchiveApps2.png "Select user screen")

For each employee, they can either reject the deletion or send a reminder.

![Cleanup screen.](media/ArchiveApps3.png "Cleanup screen")

They can send the person to the app to do the cleanup as well. There, they're able to approve or reject deletion for all their objects.

#### App and Flow Inactivity Notifications Clean Up View

This app gives the admin a view of all objects currently being considered for archival and deletion. An admin can filter to the apps that have been rejected with a note to review:

![View all objects in review.](media/ArchiveApps5.png "View all objects in review")

If the reason is sound, they can choose to exempt the object from future runs and consideration for archival and deletion.

![Excuse from archival flows.](media/ArchiveApps6.png "Excuse from archival flows.")

## Microsoft Teams governance

>[!NOTE]
>These components don't work in GCC High and DoD because those regions don't support posting adaptive cards to Teams.

### Flows

| Flow | Type | Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- |
|[Microsoft Teams Admin \|  Ask for Business Justification when Microsoft Teams environment is created](#microsoft-teams-admin--ask-for-business-justification-when-microsoft-teams-environment-is-created) | Automated |  Triggered by Admin \| Sync Template v3 |
| [Microsoft Teams Admin \|  Weekly Clean Up of Microsoft Teams environments](#microsoft-teams-admin--weekly-clean-up-of-microsoft-teams-environments) | Schedule | Weekly |
| [Microsoft Teams Admin \| Send Reminder Mail](#microsoft-teams-admin--send-reminder-mail) | Schedule | Daily

#### Microsoft Teams Admin | Ask for Business Justification when Microsoft Teams environment is created

This flow runs daily and checks whether new environments of type [Microsoft Teams](../../admin/about-teams-environment.md) are created. Team owners who create Microsoft Teams environments receive an adaptive card via Teams that prompts them to provide a business justification.

Additionally, this flow sends a welcome email to new team owners to provide them with further information about their environment. This email includes a link to the policy documentation you set up as part of [Set up inventory components](setup-core-components.md).

Save a copy of this flow if you want to change the wording in the emails or adaptive cards.

Learn more about the Microsoft Teams governance process in the CoE Starter Kit: [Microsoft Dataverse for Teams environment management](teams-governance.md)

#### Microsoft Teams Admin | Weekly Clean Up of Microsoft Teams environments

> [!NOTE]
> Automatically deleting an inactive Dataverse for Teams environment is now part of the Power Platform admin center. Learn more in [Automatic deletion of inactive Microsoft Dataverse for Teams environments](../../admin/inactive-teams-environment.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This flow deletes environments for which no business justification exists, or where the business justification is rejected. Environment owners have seven days to provide a business justification before the environment gets deleted.

This flow runs weekly and deletes environments that:

- Are created more than **7 days** ago and have no business justification, or the business justification is rejected by the admin.
- Are created more than **90 days** ago and have no apps or flows in the environment.

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, bots created via Microsoft Copilot Studio in Microsoft Teams environments aren't discoverable in the CoE Starter Kit.

Environments are deleted from the tenant and marked as deleted in the Environment table of the CoE Starter Kit. You can view deleted environments in the [Power Platform Admin View](core-components.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can recover a recently deleted environment (within seven days of deletion) by using the Power Platform admin center or the Power Apps cmdlet Recover-AdminPowerAppEnvironment. Learn more in [Power Platform admin center](../../admin/recover-environment.md#power-platform-admin-center).

Save a copy of this flow if you want to make any changes to the criteria for when environments are deleted.

Learn more about the Microsoft Teams governance process in the CoE Starter Kit: [Microsoft Dataverse for Teams environment management](teams-governance.md)

#### Microsoft Teams Admin \| Send Reminder Mail

This flow sends a daily reminder email to environment owners who are asked for a business justification for their Dataverse for Teams environment but don't yet provide one. The email additionally provides information on how to turn on flow integration in Microsoft Teams.

## Cleanup for orphaned resources

>[!NOTE]
>These components don't work in GCC High and DoD because those regions don't support posting adaptive cards to Teams.

[Watch a walk-through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zptiBppTNo&list=PLi9EhCY4z99W5kzaPK1np6sv6AzMQDsXG) of how the cleanup for orphaned objects process works.

### Flows

| Flow | Type | Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Request Orphaned Objects Reassigned (Parent)](#request-orphaned-objects-reassigned-parent) | Schedule | weekly |
| [Request Orphaned Objects Reassigned (Child)](#request-orphaned-objects-reassigned-child) | Instant | child |

#### Request Orphaned Objects Reassigned (Parent)

Runs daily and collects all orphaned objects in the tenant. It tries to associate these objects with the manager of the former owner. The flow sends a Teams bot note to each impacted manager to let them know there are objects to clean. It then concurrently calls the child flow for each manager.

If the flow finds orphaned objects that can't resolve to a previous manager, it sends a list to the admin email so admins know which orphaned objects need to be cleaned manually.

![Orphaned object count.](media/orphanedobjects1.png "Orphaned object count")

#### Request Orphaned Objects Reassigned (Child)

Triggers daily for every manager who has objects owned by former employees who left the company. It shows all the cloud flows and canvas apps owned by the former employees and lets the manager decide what to do with them:

1. Email themselves the list.
1. Take ownership of them all.
1. Delete them all.
1. Assign them all to someone else.
1. See each one individually.

![Orphaned object list.](media/orphanedobjects2.png "Orphaned object list")

If they choose to see the items individually, they can make these decisions granularly.

![Orphaned object item.](media/orphanedobjects3.png "Orphaned object item")

## App quarantine process

The app quarantine process automatically restricts access to noncompliant applications and provides mechanisms for administrators to manage quarantined apps and notify makers of compliance requirements.

### Environment variables

| Name | Description | Default value |
|------|---------------|------|
| Quarantine Apps after x days of noncompliance | If you use the Compliance flow for apps to gather compliance details from makers, specify if you want to quarantine apps when they're not compliant. Enter the number of days. | 7 days |

### Flows

| Flow | Type | Schedule |
| --- | --- | --- |
|[Admin \| Quarantine non-compliant apps](#admin--quarantine-non-compliant-apps) | Scheduled |  Daily |
| [Admin \| Set app quarantine status](#admin--set-app-quarantine-status) | Automated | When the Quarantine App field in the Power Apps App table is changed |

#### Admin \| Quarantine non-compliant apps

This flow runs on a schedule and checks if any apps need quarantining based on the following criteria:

- The environment is included in the quarantine process.
- The maker requested compliance details but didn't submit them, and the request is pending longer than the number of days specified in the **Quarantine Apps after x days of non-compliance** environment variable.
- The app isn't already quarantined.
- The admin risk assessment status isn't complete.

For any apps that match these criteria, the flow sets the app quarantine status to **Yes**. If a maker submits compliance details through the [Developer Compliance Center](#developer-compliance-center), the app doesn't automatically release from quarantine. An admin must perform a risk assessment and manually release the app from quarantine by using the [Power Platform Admin View](core-components.md#power-platform-admin-view).

To release an app from quarantine, use the [Power Platform Admin View](core-components.md#power-platform-admin-view) to set the **Quarantine App** field to **No** and mark the **Admin Requirement - Risk Assessment State** as **Complete**.

#### Admin \| Set app quarantine status

This flow triggers automatically when the app quarantine status field of the Power Apps App table is updated.

This field:

- The Admin \| Quarantine noncompliant apps sets this field to **Yes**.
- The admin can manually update this field to **Yes** or **No** from the [Power Platform Admin View](core-components.md#power-platform-admin-view) to quarantine apps or release apps from quarantine.

This flow sets the quarantine status of the app.

If the app is quarantined, the flow sends an email to the maker to inform them their app can no longer be launched.

![The app maker gets an email notification to inform them their app has been quarantined, and to ask them to submit compliance details in the Developer Compliance Center app.](media/quarantine4.png "The app maker gets an email notification to inform them their app has been quarantined, and to ask them to submit compliance details in the Developer Compliance Center app.")

If the app is released from quarantine, the flow sends an email to the maker to inform them the app is available for use again.

![The app maker gets an email notification to inform them their app has been released from quarantine.](media/quarantine3.png "The app maker gets an email notification to inform them their app has been released from quarantine.")

Apps that are quarantined also appear in the [Developer Compliance Center](#developer-compliance-center) as **Non-Compliant**.
