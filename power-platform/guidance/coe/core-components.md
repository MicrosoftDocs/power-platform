# Use core components

These components provide the core to get started with setting up a Center of Excellence (CoE). They sync all your resources into entities and build admin apps on top of that to help you get more visibility of the apps, flows, and makers in your environment. Additionally, apps like the Set App Permissions help with daily admin tasks. The core components solution contains assets relevant only to admins. More information: [Set up core components](setup-core-components.md)

> [!NOTE]
> To easily explore and manage data stored in Common Data Service, we recommend that you install the [Microsoft Power Apps Office Add-in](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104380330?tab=Overview). More information: [Working with data in Common Data Service using the Excel Add-in!](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/cds-for-apps-excel-importexport/)

## Flows

### Admin \| Sync Template v2

The Admin \| Sync Template v2 flow runs on a weekly schedule, retrieves the environments in your tenant by using [List Environments as Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerplatformforadmins/#list-environments-as-admin), and creates or updates a record for each environment in the Common Data Service Environment entity.

Running this flow will also trigger the rest of the sync flows indirectly by updating the environment records in the Common Data Service instance.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Apps)

The Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Apps) flow runs when an environment is created or modified, and gets app information by using [Get Apps as Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerappsforadmins/#get-apps-as-admin). This information is then created or updated in the PowerApps App entity.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Flows)

The Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Flows) flow runs when an environment is created or modified, and gets flow information by using [List Flows as Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/flowmanagement/#list-flows-as-admin). Also updates the record if flows have been deleted.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Flow Action Details)

The Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Flow Action Details) flow runs once daily on a schedule, and gets the actions and triggers for all flows.

> [!WARNING]
> This flow uses [Get Flow as Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/flowmanagement/#get-flow-as-admin) to get action and trigger details for every individual flow in your tenant. Thus, it can be a very time-consuming and resource-consuming flow to run.<br><br>Turning on this flow is optional, and we recommend that you do so only to perform action-level reporting or analysis, such as reporting on who's using the Send Email action of the Microsoft 365 Outlook connector.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Connectors)

The Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Connectors) flow runs once daily on a schedule, gets connector information by using [Get Connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerappsforappmakers/#get-connectors), and stores information such as the connector name, publisher, and tier.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Custom Connector)

The Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Custom Connector) flow runs when an environment is created or modified, gets custom connector information by using [Get Custom Connectors as Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerappsforadmins/#get-custom-connectors-as-admin), and stores information such as the name, endpoint, and created by/on.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Model Driven Apps)

The Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Model Driven Apps) flow runs when an environment is created or modified, and gets model-driven app information. This information is retrieved from underlying Common Data Service entities and requires the user running the flow to have system administrator privileges in the environment.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (PVA)

The Admin \| Sync Template v2 (PVA) flow runs when an environment is created or updated, and retrieves Power Virtual Agents (bot) information. This information is retrieved from underlying Common Data Service entities and requires the user running the flow to have system administrator privileges in the environment.

Turning on this flow is optional, and we recommend that you do so only if you're using Power Virtual Agents in your tenant and are interested in getting a tenant-wide overview.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Sync Flow Errors)

The Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Sync Flow Errors) flow runs on a schedule, and sends an email to the admin about environments that failed to sync (with a link to the flow instance).

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (RPA)

The Admin \| Sync Template v2 (RPA) flow runs when an environment is created or updated, and retrieves UI flow information. This information is retrieved from underlying Common Data Service entities and requires the user running the flow to have system administrator privileges in the environment.

Turning on this flow is optional, and we recommend that you do so only if you're using UI flows in your tenant and are interested in getting a tenant-wide overview.

### Admin \| Sync Template v2 (UI flow runs)

The Admin \| Sync Template v2 (UI flow runs) flow runs on a schedule, and gets UI flow run history and session details.

Turning on this flow is optional, and we recommended that you do so only if you're using UI flows in your tenant and are interested in getting a tenant-wide overview.

### CLEANUP - Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Power Apps User Shared With)

This long running flow runs every other week, and gets who the app is shared with by using [Get App Role Assignments as Admin](https://docs.microsoft.com/connectors/powerappsforadmins/#get-app-role-assignments-as-admin).

### CLEANUP - Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Check Deleted)

This long running flow runs every other week, and compares CoE to the tenant to determine if any objects were deleted since last run. Either just marks them as deleted (if env var Also Delete from CoE = no) or deletes them from the CoE (if Also Delete from CoE = yes).

The audit log solution is able to find this information in on a daily basis for apps and flows, but not for other resources such as environments, UI flows and chatbots. Run this flow periodically to check for deleted resources.

### CLEANUP - Admin \| Sync Template v2 (Orphaned Makers)

This flow runs weekly, and checks if any makers have left the organization - if maker information can not be found in Azure AD/Office 365 Users, any resources created by the maker (apps, flows, environments, chatbots and UI flows) are marked as orphaned.

## Apps

<!--### DLP Editor

DLP Editor is a canvas app that reads and updates data loss prevention (DLP) policies while showing a list of apps that are affected by the policy configurations.

Use this app to:

- Make changes to DLP policies.
- See what impact each change will have.
- Mitigate the risk that changes in DLP policies will break a flow or an app by contacting makers.
