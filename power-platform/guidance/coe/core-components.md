# Use core components

These components provide the core to get started setting up a Center of Excellence (CoE). The components sync all your resources into tables and build admin apps on top of them to help you get more visibility of the apps, flows, and makers in your environment. Apps like **Manage Permissions** help with daily admin tasks. The core components solution contains assets relevant only to admins. For more information, see [Set up core components](setup-core-components.md) and [Watch](https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0kJQAeKthw) how to use the core components solution.

[Watch an overview](https://www.youtube.com/embed/l0kJQAeKthw) on how to use the core components solution.

## Inventory components

### Tables

> [!NOTE]
> To easily explore and manage data stored in Dataverse, we recommend you install the [Microsoft Power Apps Office Add-in](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/office/WA104380330?tab=Overview). For more information, see [Working with data in Dataverse using the Excel Add-in!](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/cds-for-apps-excel-importexport/).

#### Tenant objects

The [sync flows](#flows) of the CoE Starter Kit sync your tenant resources to the following Dataverse tables. All tables provide information about _created by_ or _created on_ and _modified by_ or _modified on_, plus resource-specific information.

- **AiBuilderModel** is an Ai Builder Model.

- **Business Process Flow** is a business process flow.

- **CoE Connection Reference** is the linking table for the many-to-many relationships among connectors (PowerApps Connector) and cloud flows (Flows) or apps (PowerApps App). This reference isn't currently available for data export architecture.

- **Desktop Flow** is a desktop flow.

- **Environment** is the Environment object, which contains apps, flows, and connectors.

- **Flow** is the cloud flow in the tenant.

- **PowerApps App** is an app, such as a canvas, model driven, or other type of app.

#### Users

There are several concepts of _users_ in the inventory.

- **Connection Reference Identity** stores a list of a single instance of all user connections for each environment.

- **Environment Security Role Permission** is a permission to an environment. Including the user, the security role, the environment and other properties.

- **Maker** is a user who creates an object, such as an app, flow, custom connector, or other item.

- **Power Platform User** is who an app is shared with.

- **Power Platform User Role** represents the role a Microsoft Power Platform user has for a specific app. This has a one-to-many relationship with the Power Platform User and PowerApps App tables. The following information is available for each role:
  - App
  - Microsoft Power Platform user
  - Role name (Owner, CanEdit, CanView)
  - Friendly role name (Owner, Co-Owner, Viewer)

- **Microsoft Copilot Studio** represents a bot in Microsoft Copilot Studio. The following information is available for each bot:

  - Error Code
  - Error Message

#### Inventory Management Features

These tables store information about usage for management.

- **Data Policy Drafts** is a draft DLP that you're working through in the [DLP Impact Analysis](#dlp-impact-analysis) app.

- **DLP Impact Analysis** is an instance violating a draft DLP that you're working through with a Maker in the [DLP Impact Analysis](#dlp-impact-analysis) app.

- **Environment Business Area** is the owning business area of an environment, if cross-charging is required.

- **Flow Action Detail** is the set of actions that occur in a cloud flow. This table has a many-to-one link with the Flow table.

#### Solution Management

These tables are used to manage the CoE solution itself.

- **CoE Solution Metadata** holds meta-data about flows and apps part of the CoE Starter Kit in a table and is used in the [CoE Admin Command Center](#coe-admin-command-center).

- **Command Center Config** holds bookmark information to for the Bookmarks page of the [CoE Admin Command Center](#coe-admin-command-center).

- **Customized Email** holds metadata about emails sent from flows in the Core Solution to allow for admins to tailor them without making unmanaged layers on the flows.

- **Setup Wizard State metadata** represents the current state of the user in the Setup Wizard. This metadata is used to guide them through the steps.

- **Sync Flow Errors** represents the daily occurrence of sync flow errors to provide a summary email to an admin. The following information is available for each sync flow error.

  - Flow instance URL
  - Environment
  - Created on

- **Tenant Security Roles** are all security roles in the tenant and allow you to determine which ones you want to gather.

### Security roles

These security roles only grant permissions to the custom tables but not to the environment as a whole. If you want users to view apps and flows in the environment, grant them access individually to each object. You can add them to another security role like **System Admin** or **Environment Maker**.

For more information, see [Security roles and privileges](/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges).

- **Power Platform Admin SR** gives full access to create, read, write, and delete operations on the custom tables.

- **Power Platform Maker SR** gives read and write access to the custom tables, such as environments or apps.

- **Power Platform User SR** gives read-only access to resources in the custom tables.

### Flows

| Flow Name | Type | Interval | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| Admin \| Add Maker to Group | Automated | New makers added | This flow adds a user who created an app, flow, custom connector, or environment for the first time to your Maker group. This flow gets triggered when a new record is created in the maker table. |
| Admin \| Excuse Non-Inventoried Envts from Governance Flows | Automated | When the **Excuse from Inventory** column of an environment is changed | If you're only doing inventory for a subset of environments (not the default behavior), this flow ensures ignored environments have their _excuse from_ flags set correctly. |
| Admin \| Excuse Support Envts from Governance Flows | Automated | When an environment record is created in the **Environments** table | This flow checks if [support environments](/power-platform/admin/support-environment#what-are-support-environments) exist and excludes these environments from the [inactivity](governance-components.md#inactivity-processes) and [compliance](governance-components.md#compliance-processes) governance processes. |
| Admin \| Gather Tenant SRs | Schedule | Monthly | This flow retrieves the security roles in your tenant and ensures they're in the **Tenant Security Roles** table for management. |
| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Call Updates) | Scheduled | Weekly | Used to trigger other flows to run on a weekly schedule. Needed so that those flows can be of type button and be used to run on demand or on a schedule.|
| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Connectors) | Button | Triggered from **Admin \| Sync Template v3** (call updates) and manually from apps  | This flow gets connector information, by using [Get Connectors](/connectors/powerappsforappmakers/#get-connectors), and stores information such as the connector name, publisher, and tier. |
| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Flow Action Details) | Automated | Triggered by **Admin \| Sync Template v4** (driver) | This flow gets the actions and triggers for all flows. This flow uses [Get Flow as Admin](/connectors/flowmanagement/#get-flow-as-admin) to get action and trigger details for each flow in your tenant, so it can be time-consuming and resource-consuming to run. Turning on this flow is optional. Turn on to perform action-level reporting or analysis, such as reporting on who's using the **Send Email** action of the Microsoft 365 Outlook connector. |
| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Sync Flow Errors) | Scheduled | Daily | This flow sends an email to the admin about environments that failed to sync (with a link to the flow instance). |

| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Desktop Flow) | Automated | triggered by Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Driver) | This flow retrieves desktop flow information. This information is retrieved from underlying Dataverse tables and requires the user running the flow to have system administrator privileges in the environment. Turning on this flow is optional. Only turn this flow on if a tenant-level overview of desktop flows is important. |
| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Environment Properties) | Automated | triggered by Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Driver) | This flow retrieves add-on, capacity, and security role information for environments. This information is retrieved from the Power Platform admin connector and from underlying Dataverse tables, and requires the user running the flow to have system administrator privileges in the environment. |
| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Flow Action Details) | Scheduled | Daily | This flow gets the actions and triggers for all flows. This flow uses [Get Flow as Admin](/connectors/flowmanagement/#get-flow-as-admin) to get action and trigger details for every individual flow in your tenant. Thus, it can be a very time-consuming and resource-consuming flow to run. Turning on this flow is optional, only do so to perform action-level reporting or analysis, such as reporting on who's using the Send Email action of the Microsoft 365 Outlook connector. |
| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Flows) | Automated | triggered by Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Driver) | This flow gets cloud flow information by using [List Flows as Admin](/connectors/flowmanagement/#list-flows-as-admin). Also updates the record if flows have been deleted. |
| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Model Driven Apps) | Automated | triggered by Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Driver) | This flow gets model-driven app information.

| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Microsoft Copilot Studio) | Automated | triggered by Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Driver) | This flow retrieves Microsoft Copilot Studio (bot) information. This information is retrieved from underlying Dataverse tables and requires the user running the flow to have system administrator privileges in the environment. Turning on this flow is optional. Only turn this flow on if a tenant-level overview of chatbots is important. |
| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Microsoft Copilot Studio Usage) | Scheduled | Daily | This flow retrieves Microsoft Copilot Studio (bot) usage information on a daily basis. This information is retrieved from underlying Dataverse tables and requires the user running the flow to have system administrator privileges in the environment. Turning on this flow is optional, and we recommend that you do so only if you're using Microsoft Copilot Studio in your tenant and are interested in getting a tenant-wide overview. |
| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Sync Flow Errors) | Scheduled | Daily | This flow sends an email to the admin about environments that failed to sync (with a link to the flow instance). |
| Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Call Updates) | Scheduled | Daily | Used to trigger these three flows to run on a schedule. Needed so that those flows can be of type button and be used to be run on demand or on a schedule.|
| Admin \| Excuse Support Envts from Governance Flows | Automated | When an environment record is created in the Environments table | This flow checks if [support environments](/power-platform/admin/support-environment#what-are-support-environments) exist, and excludes those environments from the [inactivity](governance-components.md#inactivity-processes) and [compliance](governance-components.md#compliance-processes) governance processes. |
| CLEANUP - Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Check Deleted) | Scheduled | Every two weeks | This long running flow runs every other week, and compares CoE to the tenant to determine if any objects were deleted since last run. Either just marks them as deleted (if env var Also Delete from CoE = no) or deletes them from the CoE (if Also Delete from CoE = yes). The audit log solution is able to find this information in on a daily basis for apps and flows, but not for other resources such as environments, desktop flows and chatbots. Run this flow periodically to check for deleted resources. |
| CLEANUP - Admin \| Sync Template v3 (Connection Status) | Scheduled | Weekly | This flow runs weekly, and checks if any apps or flows have unresolved connections.|

## Environment Request management components

[Watch a walk-through](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=16mspbGz1zA&list=PLi9EhCY4z99W5kzaPK1np6sv6AzMQDsXG) of how the environment and DLP request process works.

### Environment Request Tables

- **Environment Creation Request** is a request submitted by nonadmins to create a new Environment. This request has a many-to-many relationship with the Maker and PowerApps Connector tables.

- **DLP Impact Analysis** is an instance of an object, which violates a draft DLP Policy.

- **DLP Policy** is a DLP Policy you can offer to makers for selection in an environment request.

- **DLP Policy Change Request** is a request to change the definition of an existing DLP policy in the tenant.

### Environment Request Flows

| Flow Name | Type | Interval | Description |
| ---- | ---- | --- | ---- |
| DLP Request \| Apply Policy to Environment (Child) | Instant | When creating an environment with a given policy | Helper function that takes the Power Platform Policy ID and an Environment ID as input and applies a policy to an environment. The function removes the environment from all other "Include" type policies and excludes it from all "Exclude" type policies.  |
| DLP Request \| Process Approved Policy Change | Automated | When a **DLP Policy Change Request** record is updated to the **Approved** state | Automated flow that triggers when the approval status of a **DLP Policy Change Request** is updated to an _Approved_ state. This flow calls a child flow to make the change on the Power Platform service, for example updates the DLP policy, then updates the Dataverse request record to the _Fulfilled_ state.  |
| DLP Request \| Sync new Policy | Automated | When a new DLP Policy row is created and _Is Shared_ is true | When a new DLP Policy row is created and _Is Shared_ is true, it triggers the **Sync Policy** child flow and syncs the blocked connectors to the Dataverse row. |
| DLP Request \| Sync Policy to Dataverse (Child) | Instant | Called from other flows in this solution area | Takes the DLP Policy identifier as input (Dataverse record) and syncs the blocked connectors to the Dataverse policy row. |
| DLP Request \| Sync Shared Policies | Scheduled | Daily | Runs daily to keep the Dataverse version of each DLP Policy marked as `"Is Shared" == True` updated with the real policy's blocked connectors.  |
| Env Request \| Clean up | Schedule | Daily | Runs daily to delete environments with an associated expired **Request** record, to send warning emails to upcoming deletions, and to close out associated **Request** records where the environment is manually deleted from the admin center. |
| Env Request \| Create approved environment | Automated | When an **Environment Creation Request**’s status is updated to an _Approved_ state | Provisions the environment and other resources identified in the request. |
| Env Request \| Notify admin when a new request is submitted | Automated | When a new E**nvironment Creation Request** record’s status is updated by a user to a _Pending_ state | Sends an email to the admin alias with instructions on how to review the request. |
| Env Request \| Notify requestor when rejected | Automated | When an **Environment Creation Request**’s status is updated to the _Rejected_ state | Sends an email notification to the requestor with the rejection status and reason, then changes the request to inactive. |

### Environment Request Apps

#### CoE Admin Environment Request

The CoE Admin Environment Request app is used by admins as an interface to view and approve or reject requests to create or modify Power Platform development resources.

#### CoE Maker Command Center

An app designed to help makers interact with their Power Platform Admin in many ways, including submitting requests for Power Platform resources (such as **Environment Creation Requests**).

Use this app to:

- See apps shared with the makers by the Power Platform admin.
- Submit new **Environment Creation Requests**.
- View existing requests in any state submitted by that user. Here you can find an expiration timeline and link to the live environments.

**Permission**: As soon as you're using this process, you can share the app with all authorized makers or the entire organization, depending on which users you want to allow **Environment** ownership. Requires the Power Platform Maker SR (security role) to use the Dataverse tables.

**Prerequisite**: This app uses Dataverse. End-users must have a **Per User** license, the app must be assigned a **Per App** license, or the environment must be covered by pay-as-you-go.

### Other Apps

#### App Catalog

An app gives visibility to some apps in the organization. Admins can choose which apps to highlight in the app catalog if the app meets admin requirements and is meant to be shared broadly.

When you first open the app catalog, you don't see any apps there. There's a field on the **Power Apps App** table called **In App Catalog**, which is a two-option set type field (Boolean). If the value is set to **Yes**, the app shows up in the catalog. To publish an app to the app catalog, follow the [app auditing process](example-processes.md) in the **Power Platform Admin View** app.

**Permission**: As soon as you use this process, you can share the app catalog with the entire organization.

**Prerequisite**: This app uses Dataverse. If you installed this solution in a production environment, end-users need to have a **Per User** license, or the app needs to be assigned a **Per App** license, or the environment needs to be covered by pay-as-you-go.
