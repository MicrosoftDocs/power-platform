# Set up the audit log connector

> [!NOTE]
> This Audit Log solution is not available for Dataverse for Teams.

The Audit Log Sync flow connects to the Microsoft 365 audit log to gather telemetry data (unique users, launches) for apps. The flow uses a custom connector to connect to the Audit Log. In the following instructions, you'll set up the custom connector and configure the flow.

The Center of Excellence (CoE) Starter Kit will work without this flow, but the usage information (app launches, unique users) in the Power BI dashboard will be blank.

## Before you use the audit log connector

1. Microsoft 365 audit log search must be turned on for the audit log connector to work. More information: [Turn audit log search on or off](/microsoft-365/compliance/turn-audit-log-search-on-or-off?preserve-view=true&view=o365-worldwide)
1. You must have access to the audit log. The Microsoft Power Platform Service Admin role doesn't give you access to the audit log. More information: [Search the audit log in the Security & Compliance Center](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?preserve-view=true&view=o365-worldwide#before-you-search-the-audit-log)
1. Your tenant must have a subscription that supports unified audit logging. More information: [Security & Compliance Center availability for business and enterprise plans](/office365/servicedescriptions/office-365-platform-service-description/office-365-securitycompliance-center)

The Office 365 Management APIs use Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) to provide authentication services that you can use to grant rights for your application to access them.

### Create an Azure AD app registration for the Office 365 Management API

Using these steps, you'll set up an Azure AD app registration that will be used in a custom connector and Power Automate flow to connect to the audit log. More information: [Get started with Office 365 Management APIs](/office/office-365-management-api/get-started-with-office-365-management-apis)

1. Sign in to [portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Go to **Azure Active Directory** > **App registrations**.

   ![Azure AD app registration.](media/coe33.png "Azure AD app registration")

1. Select **+ New Registration**.

1. Enter a name (for example, **Microsoft 365 Management**), don't change any other setting, and then select **Register**.

1. Select **API Permissions** > **+ Add a permission**.

   ![API Permissions - Add a permission.](media/coe34.png "Add a permission")

1. Select **Office 365 Management API**, and configure permissions as follows:

   1. Select **Delegated permissions**, and then select **ActivityFeed.Read**.

      ![Delegated permissions.](media/coe36.png "Delegated permissions")

   1. Select **Application permissions**, and then select **ActivityFeed.Read** and **ServiceHealth.Read**.

      ![Application permissions.](media/coe37.png "Application permissions")

   1. Select **Add permissions**.

1. Select **Grant Admin Consent for (your organization)**.

   The API permissions now reflect delegated **ActivityFeed.Read**, and application **ActivityFeed.Read** and **ServiceHealth.Read** permissions, with a status of **Granted for _(your organization)_**.

   ![API permissions.](media/coe38.png "API permissions")

1. Select **Certificates and secrets**.

1. Select **+ New client secret**.

   ![New client secret.](media/coe39.png "New client secret")

1. Add a description and expiration (in line with your organization's policies), and then select **Add**.

1. Copy and paste the **Secret** to a text document in Notepad for the time being.

1. Select **Overview**, and copy and paste the application (client) ID and directory (tenant) ID values to the same text document; be sure to make a note of which GUID is for which value. You'll need these values in the next step as you configure the custom connector.

Leave the Azure portal open, because you'll need to make some configuration updates after you set up the custom connector.

### Set up the custom connector

Now you'll configure and set up a custom connector that uses the [Office 365 Management APIs](/office/office-365-management-api/get-started-with-office-365-management-apis).

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com) > **Data** > **Custom Connectors**. The Office 365 Management API custom connector will be listed here; it has been imported with the core components solution.
1. Select **Edit**.

  ![Custom connector setup.](media/coe-custom1.png "Custom connector setup")

1. If your tenant is in the commercial cloud, leave  the **1. General** page as-is. If your tenant is in the Government cloud, you have to change the host URL on the **1. General** page:

   >[!IMPORTANT]
   > - If your tenant is a GCC tenant, change the host to https://manage-gcc.office.com.
   > - If your tenant is a GCC high tenant, change the host to https://manage.office365.us.
   > - If your tenant is a DoD tenant, change the host to https://manage.protection.apps.mil.
   >
   > More information: [Activity API operations](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference?preserve-view=true&view=o365-worldwide#activity-api-operations)

1. Select **Security**.
1. Select **Edit** at the bottom of the **OAuth 2.0** area to edit the authentication parameters.

   ![Edit OAuth configuration.](media/coe42.png "Edit OAuth configuration")

1. Paste the application (client) ID you copied from the app registration into **Client Id**.

1. Paste the client secret you copied from the app registration into **Client secret**.

1. Don't change the **Tenant ID**.

1. Leave the **Login URL** as is  for commercial and GCC tenants, and change it to https://login.microsoftonline.us/ for a GCC High or DoD tenant.

1. Set the **Resource URL** to https://manage.office.com for a commercial tenant, https://manage-gcc.office.com for a GCC tenant, https://manage.office365.us for a GCC high tenant and https://manage.protection.apps.mil for a DoD tenant.

1. Copy the **Redirect URL** into your text document in Notepad.

1. Select **Update Connector**.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a [data loss prevention (DLP) policy](../../admin/wp-data-loss-prevention.md) configured for your CoE Starter Kit environment, you'll need to add this connector to the business data&ndash;only group of this policy.

### Update Azure AD app registration with the redirect URL

1. Go back to the Azure portal and your app registrations.

1. Under **Overview**, select **Add a Redirect URI**.

1. Select **+ Add a platform** > **Web**.

1. Enter the URL you copied from the **Redirect URL** section of the custom connector.

1. Select **Configure**.

### Start a subscription to audit log content

Go back to the custom connector to set up a connection to the custom connector and [start a subscription to the audit log content](/office/office-365-management-api/office-365-management-activity-api-reference#start-a-subscription), as described in the following steps.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must complete these steps for subsequent steps to work. If you don't create a new connection and test the connector here, setting up the flow and child flow in later steps will fail.

1. On the **Custom Connector** page, select **4. Test**.

1. Select **+ New connection**, and then sign in with your account.

1. Under **Operations**, select **StartSubscription**.

   ![Custom connector Start Subscription.](media/coe43.png "Custom connector Start Subscription")

1. Paste the **directory (tenant) ID**&mdash;copied earlier from the **App Registration** overview page in Azure AD&mdash;into the **Tenant** field, and then paste the **application (client) ID** into **PublisherIdentifier**.

1. Select **Test Operation**.

You should see a (200) status returned, which means the query was successful.

![Successful status being returned from the StartSubscription activity.](media/coe44.png "Successful status being returned from the StartSubscription activity")

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you don't see a (200) response, the request has failed. There's an error with your setup that's keeping the flow from working. Common issues to check are: 
>
> - Are audit logs enabled, and do you have permission to view the audit logs? Check [protection.office.com](https://protection.office.com) > **Search** > **Audit Log Search**.
> - If you don't have permissions, see [Before you search the audit log](/microsoft-365/compliance/search-the-audit-log-in-security-and-compliance?preserve-view=true&view=o365-worldwide#before-you-search-the-audit-log).
> - Have you enabled the audit log very recently? If so, try again in a few minutes, to give the audit log time to activate.
> - Have you pasted in the correct tenant ID from your Azure AD app registration?
> - Have you pasted in the correct resource URL, with no added spaces or characters at the end?
> - Validate that you correctly followed the steps in [Azure AD app registration](#create-an-azure-ad-app-registration-for-the-office-365-management-api)
> - Validate that you correctly updated the security settings of the custom connector, as described in [step 6 of the custom connector setup](#set-up-the-custom-connector) procedure earlier in this article.

### Set up the Power Automate flow

A Power Automate flow uses the custom connector, queries the audit log daily, and writes the Power Apps launch events to a Microsoft Dataverse table, which is then used in the Power BI dashboard to report on sessions and unique users of an app.

1. Follow the instructions in [Set up core components](setup-core-components.md) to download the solution.
1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com).
1. Import the Center of Excellence audit logs solution (CenterofExcellenceAuditLogs_*x_x_x_xxx*_managed.zip).
1. Establish connections to activate your solution. If you create a new connection, you must select **Refresh**. You won't lose your import progress.
    ![Import the CoE audit log components solution.](media/coe-custom2.png "Import the CoE audit log components solution")

1. Open the **Center of Excellence – Audit Log solution**.
1. [Remove the unmanaged layer](setup.md#installing-updates) from the **Admin \| \[Child\] Admin | Sync Logs**.
1. Select the **Admin \| \[Child\] Admin | Sync Logs**.
1. Edit the **Run only users** settings.

   ![Child flow - run only users.](media/coe49.png "Child flow - run only users")

1. For the custom connector, Dataverse and Office 365 Outlook, change the value to **Use this connection (userPrincipalName\@company.com)**. If there is no connection for any of the connectors, go to **Data** > **Connections**, and create one for the connector.

   ![Configure run only users.](media/coe50.png "Configure run only users")

1. Select **Save**, and then close the **Flow details** tab.

1. (Optional) Edit the TimeInterval-Unit and TimeInterval-Interval environment variables to gather smaller chunks of time. The default value is to chunk 1 day into 1 hour segments. You will receive an alert from this solution if the Audit Log fails to collect all data with your configured time interval.

    | Name | Description |
    |------|---------------|
    |StartTime-Interval | Must be a whole number to represent the start time for how far back to fetch. <br> Default value: 1 (for 1 day back) |
    |StartTime-Unit | Determines units for how far back in time to go to fetch data. <br>Must be a value from accepted as an input parameter to [Add to Time](/power-automate/desktop-flows/actions-reference/datetime#add). <br> Example legal values: Minute, Hour, Day <br>Default value: Day |
    |TimeInterval-Unit | Determines units for chunking the time since start. <br>Must be a value from accepted as an input parameter to [Add to Time](/power-automate/desktop-flows/actions-reference/datetime#add). <br> Example legal values: Minute, Hour, Day <br>Default value: Hour |
    |TimeInterval-Interval | Must be a whole number to represent the number of chunks of type unit (above).<br> Default value: 1 (for 1 hour chunks) |
    |TimeSegment-CountLimit | Must be a whole number to represent the limit on the number of chunks that can be created.<br> Default value: 60 |

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The default values provided work in a medium sized tenant. You may have to adjust the values multiple times for this to work for your tenant size.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
