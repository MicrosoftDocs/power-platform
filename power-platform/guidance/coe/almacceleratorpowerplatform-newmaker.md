## Walk-through: The ALM Accelerator for Power Platform app new maker experience

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following user experience has been configured with the Power Platform ALM Accelerator Administration app, which is installed with the ALM accelerator. For information about how to use the administration app, and configure and share experiences, go to [Creating user settings and profiles](setup-almacceleratorpowerplatform-deployment-profiles.md).

1. After you've installed and configured the app, open it from your environment by selecting **Apps** > **ALM Accelerator for Power Platform**.

1. When prompted to create connections and grant consent, create the necessary connections or accept the consent dialog.

1. If prompted to create an HTTP with Azure AD connection, enter **https://graph.microsoft.com** for both the **Base Resource URL** and **Azure AD Resource URI**.

1. Select **Create** for each connection when prompted.

1. The first time you open the app, a dialog opens and you're asked to select an environment. Next time you open the app, it remembers which environment you were working on.

1. After the environment is selected, the main screen displays a list of all the unmanaged solutions in the environment. You can refresh the list by selecting **Refresh** if you don't see new solutions you've created:

    - **Save Solution**: Saves the current state of the solution into version control so all changes done to the solution can be tracked. Additionally, the save will create your deployment pipelines in Azure DevOps as part of the save process.
    - **Publish Solution**: Allows you to request to move the solution across environments.
    - **Choose a Profile**: Allows you to select a **Solution profile** to associate a solution to a **Repository** in a given **Organization** and **Project**. If you're unsure what profile to select, ask your administrator to provide the name of the solution profile for your solution.
    - **Request History** (**>**): Provides a list of requests (saves and deployments) done for that solution.

1. Choose a **Solution Profile** for the solution so you can associate it to a specific repository in a given organization and project in Azure DevOps. This selection will determine which environments you can deploy the solution into:

   1. Select **Choose a Profile** for your solution in the solution list.
   1. In the **Solution Profile** dialog, select a **Profile**, and then select **Save**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If you don't find a solution profile that suits your needs, contact an administrator to get it created.

1. Configure the deployment setting by selecting the **Configure Deployment Settings** link under the name of the solution. On the configuration deployment page, you'll see the following items:

   - **Deployment Environment List** (for example, validation, test, and production)

     These environments are the ones specified in the **Solution Profile**. They correspond with the environments in which your solution will be available after you publish.

1. After you select the **Solution Profile** and configure the **Deployment Settings**, push your changes to Git by selecting **Save Solution**. In the background, the app pushes your change to version control, automatically creating a branch. Repeat the pushes as you make changes to your solution so your change history is kept.

    Be sure to publish any app changes before initiating the saving of the solution. During this step you'll be asked to configure the deployment settings, which will require the same information as detailed in the previous step.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When the publishing begins, a waiting indicator appears. When the push is successful, a checkbox appears; otherwise, a red X appears.

1. Use **Deploy Solution** to publish your solution to other environments. Provide a **Title** and **Notes**. This information is added to the pull request created in Azure DevOps. Select the **Environment** you want to deploy the solution into.

1. Depending on the **Solution Profile** configuration, the application either creates a pull request that needs to be completed in Azure DevOps or triggers a pipeline that someone must approve before it can run and complete the publishing. You'll see the progress indicator state that the deployment has started. You can also use the right angle bracket (**>**) to visualize the request history.
