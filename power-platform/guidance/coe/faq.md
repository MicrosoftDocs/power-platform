# Frequently asked questions, tips, and how-to's

This article will provide you with answers to frequently asked questions and tips on setting up and using the CoE Starter Kit.

## Installing a solution in a production environment

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](<https://make.powerapps.com>).
1. Go to your CoE environment. In the example in the following screenshot, we're importing to the environment named **Contoso CoE**.

    ![Power Apps maker portal environment selection.](media/coe6.png "Power Apps maker portal environment selection")

1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.
1. Select **Import**, and then select **Browse**.
1. Select the solution from the CoE Starter Kit download.
1. Establish connections to activate your solution. If you create a new connection, you must select **Refresh**. You won't lose your import progress.

     ![Establish connections to activate your solution.](media/msi-import.png "Establish connections to activate your solution.")
1. Update environment variable values. The environment variables are used to store application and flow configuration data with data specific to your organization or environment. This means that you only have to set the value once per environment, and it will be used in all necessary flows and apps in that environment.
    ![Update environment variable values.](media/msi-envvar.png "Update environment variable values")
1. Select **Import**.

## Installing a solution in a Dataverse for Teams environment

1. Select the Microsoft Teams group you want to add the solution to.
1. [Install the Power Apps personal app in Microsoft Teams](/powerapps/teams/install-personal-app).
1. [Create your first app](/powerapps/teams/create-first-app) (at least one app is required in the environment to enable the solution import experience).
1. Open the Power Apps app in Teams, select **Build**, and then select the team you want to add the solution to.
1. Select **See All**

    ![Open the Power Apps app in Teams to import a new solution.](media/ibteams-1.png "Open the Power Apps app in Teams to import a new solution.")

1. Select **Import**
1. In the pop-up window, select **Choose File**.
1. Select the solution from the CoE Starter Kit download.
1. When the compressed (.zip) file has been loaded, select **Next**.
1. Establish connections to the required connectors. If you create a new connection, you must select **Refresh**. You won't lose your import progress.

     ![Establish connections to all connectors used in the solution.](media/coreteams-1.png "Establish connections to all connectors used in the solution.")

1. Update environment variable values. The environment variables are used to store application and flow configuration data with data specific to your organization or environment. This means that you only have to set the value once per environment, and it will be used in all necessary flows and apps in that environment.
1. Select **Import**.  
   After the import is complete, your solution will be available when you select **Installed apps**.
1. Select **See all** to see all tables, apps, and flows that are part of the solution.

    ![Select Installed Apps to view your imported solution.](media/tips-coeteams1.png "Select Installed Apps to view your imported solution")

## Set flow run-only users properties

1. Remove [unmanaged layers](after-setup.md) for all flows.
1. Go to the details page, and then select the **Run only users** edit button.

    ![Find the setting for run-only users.](media/tips-flow2.png "Find the setting for run-only users")

1. You'll see all the connections in the child flow. For each one, change the value to **Use this connection (userPrincipalName\@company.com)**.
1. If there's no connection for any of the connectors, go to **Data** > **Connections**, and create one for the connector.

    ![Configure run-only users.](media/tips-flow1.png "Configure run only users")

1. After you've updated all run-only users, you can turn on the child flow.

## Running a full inventory

The sync flows in the core component solution will only update resources that have changed since the last run. After an upgrade, you'll only see the benefits of bug fixes or changes when you run a full inventory sync by doing the following:

1. Set the value of the **Full inventory** environment variable to **Yes** (Learn more: [update environment variables](#update-environment-variables)).
1. Turn all flows in the core solution off and back on.
1. Run the Admin | Sync Template v3 flow.
1. Set the **Full inventory** environment variable back to **No**.
1. Turn all flows in the core solution off and back on.

## Update environment variables

The following limitations apply when updating environment variables:

- You can't update the values for environment variables from within the imported solution.
- You need to always add or update a current value, not the default value, because the default value will be overwritten when you install an upgrade.
- Environment variables are cached in cloud flows until the flow is reset (for example, by turning the cloud flow off and back on).

To update environment variables, you can use the [Admin - Command Center](core-components.md#admin---command-center)

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com), and then select your CoE environment
1. Open the **Admin - Command Center** app.
1. Select the tool icon, and update the current value.

    ![Update environment variable values in the Admin - Command Center app.](media/tips-command1.png "Update environment variable values in the Admin - Command Center app")

>[!NOTE]
>After changing the value of an environment variable, you'll need to turn off and on all the flows that use that environment variable to make sure the flows use the latest value.

If you aren't using the [Admin - Command Center](core-components.md#admin---command-center) app, do the following to update environment variables:

1. If you've installed the solution in a production environment, do the following:
   1. Go to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).
   1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.
   1. Select the **Default Solution**, and change the filter to show **Environment Variables**.
   1. Select a variable that you want to update, and then configure its **Current Value**.

1. If you've installed the solution in a Dataverse for Teams environment, do the following:
   1. Go to [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com).
   1. On the left pane, select **Solutions**.
   1. Select **Common Data Services Default Solution**.
   1. Select **+ Add > Environment Variables**.
   1. Select the existing environment variables from the managed solution that you want to update.
   1. Change the filter to show **Environment Variables**.
   1. Select a variable that you want to update, and then configure its **Current Value**.

## Share an app from a production environment

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com), and then select your CoE environment.
1. On the app that you want to share, select **...** > **Share**.

      ![Select the user or group to share the app with.](media/tips-share1.png "Select the user or group to share the app with")

1. Select the Dataverse security role. The CoE Starter Kit makes three security roles available:
    - **Power Platform Admin SR** for sharing an app with admins
    - **Power Platform Maker SR** for sharing an app with your makers
    - **Power Platform User SR** for sharing an app with users

      ![Assign a security role to the user or group.](media/tips-share2.png "Assign a security role to the user or group")

1. Select **Share**.

## Share an app from a Dataverse for Teams environment

1. Open the Power Apps app in Teams, select **Build**, and then select the team you've installed the CoE Starter Kit in.
1. Select **Share with colleagues**. You must be a team owner to see this option.
1. Search for and select the security group you want to share the apps and tables with.
1. Select the apps you want to share with members of this security group.

      ![Search for a group to share apps with.](media/coe-share3.png "Search for a group to share apps with")

1. Select **Save**.
1. Select **Installed apps**.
1. Select **See all** on the Center of Excellence - Core for Teams solution.
1. On the left pane, select **Tables**.
1. Select the table you want to manage, and then select **Manage Permissions**.
1. Assign [table permissions](/powerapps/teams/set-perms-and-share#assign-table-permissions) to the security group. The level of permissions will depend on the app you're sharing. Perform this step for all tables used by the app you're sharing.

      ![Assign table permissions to your colleagues.](media/coe-share4.png "Assign table permissions to your colleagues")

1. To access the app, colleagues with access can go to Microsoft Teams > **Apps** > **Built by your colleagues**, and select the app from there.

      ![Find apps in the Microsoft Teams app store.](media/coe-share5.png "Find apps in the Microsoft Teams app store")

      Note that apps are only accessible from within Microsoft Teams.

## Get a Power Apps URL from a production environment

1. Go to [make.powerapps.com](https://make.powerapps.com), and then select your CoE environment.
1. Select **Apps**.
1. Select the app of which you need the URL from.
1. Select **...** > **Details**.
1. Select the **Web link**.

      ![Get the web link for a canvas app.](media/tips-link1.png "Get the web link for a canvas app")

## Add apps to Microsoft Teams

1. Open the Power Apps app in Teams, select **Build**.
1. Select the team you've installed the CoE Starter Kit in, and then select **Installed apps**.
1. Select **Apps**, and then select **Edit** for the app you want to add to Teams.

      ![Edit the app in Teams.](media/tips-link2.png "Edit the app in teams")

1. Select **Publish to Teams** > **Next**.

      ![Publish the app to your Microsoft Teams channel.](media/tips-link3.png "Publish the app to your Microsoft Teams channel")

1. Select **Add to a Channel** > **Save and close**.

      ![Select a channel to add the app to.](media/tips-link4.png "Select a channel to add the app to")

1. If you'd like to save the app URL, go to that channel in Microsoft Teams, open the app, and then select **Copy link to tab**.

      ![Copy the link to this tab.](media/tips-link5.png "Copy the link to this tab")

## Timeouts in the Admin | Sync Template v3

The Dataverse connector might experience some throttling limits if the tenant has many resources. If you see 429 errors in the flow run history occurring in later runs, you can try the following resolution steps:

**Configure the retry policy**
  1. Open **Admin \| Sync Template v3**, and then select **Edit**.
  1. Expand the step **Get Environments and store them in the CoE Table**.
  1. Expand the step **Apply to each Environment**
  1. Go to the **Settings** pane for each call to Dataverse, and configure the timeout/retry settings. The default count is set to **10** and the default interval is set to **PT10S**. Increase these values incrementally.

     ![Configure the retry policy.](media/coe72.PNG "Configure the retry policy")

**Configure (reduce) concurrency in Foreach loops to reduce simultaneous calls**
  1. Open **Admin \| Sync Template v3**, and then select **Edit**.
  1. Expand the step **Get Environments and store them in the CoE Table**.
  1. Go to **Settings** for the **Apply to each Environment** step.

     ![Configure concurrency in Foreach.](media/coe73.PNG "Configure concurrency in Foreach")

  1. Use the slider to reduce the value of **Degree of Parallelism**. The default value is 50; reducing the parallelism here will increase the runtime of the flow, so we suggest gradually lowering the number.
