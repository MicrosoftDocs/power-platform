# ABN AMRO Bank enhances AI capabilities with Copilot Studio and Azure services

In this article, you learn how ABN AMRO Bank, one of the largest banks in the Netherlands, used Microsoft Copilot Studio to enhance its customer and employee interactions. The bank uses Azure services for platform monitoring and application lifecycle management, among other purposes. It uses Power BI for analyzing and visualizing Copilot key performance indicators.

Headquartered in Amsterdam, ABN AMRO has more than 22,000 employees and serves more than 5 million retail customers and 365,000 commercial clients in 15 countries/regions. With the adoption of Copilot Studio, ABN AMRO is now better positioned to deliver personalized and effective digital banking experiences for all its customers and employees, while using advanced AI technologies to stay at the forefront of innovation.

The bank, which was already operating several chatbots, wanted to explore a new platform to enhance its AI capabilities. "With the rapid introduction of generative AI, we anticipate that our customers are going to expect much more from a chatbot and we wanted to get ahead of that demand," says Bobby van Groningen, IT Lead at ABN AMRO.

By rapidly transitioning to Copilot Studio and deploying its new agents, ABN AMRO was able to integrate Azure AI Language conversational language understanding for superior accuracy in processing Dutch, leading to more precise and reliable customer and employee interactions.

Because Copilot Studio includes out of the box the features the bank needs, ABN AMRO significantly reduced its operational and maintenance costs. The bank also experienced reduced drop-off and transfer rates.

> Microsoft's leadership and innovation in the AI space led us to select Microsoft Copilot Studio. We also liked that many of the chatbot capabilities we needed are available out of the box. This contributed to an intuitive and easy-to-use development experience.

## Case study

In this technical case study, you learn how:

- ABN AMRO Bank enhanced customer and employee interactions using Copilot Studio, Azure, and Power BI.
- Copilot Studio improves service accuracy and efficiency while significantly reducing operational and maintenance costs.
- You can deliver personalized and effective digital customer services using advanced AI technologies.
- You can transition efficiently to a sophisticated AI platform with advanced language recognition.
- You can build a roadmap and foundation for further advanced AI features, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) patterns and language models for intent recognition.

## The scenario

As part of its strategy to enhance customer and employee interactions, ABN AMRO Bank deployed an AI-powered chatbot infrastructure called Anna for its customers. The infrastructure around Anna faced challenges such as high maintenance and scaling costs, high drop-off and transfer rates, limited capabilities that restricted evolving use cases, and difficulties in natural language understanding (NLU) performance, especially in Dutch. Anna was available as both a text-based chatbot and an interactive voice response (IVR) bot.

ABN AMRO experienced similar challenges with its internal chatbot, Abby. Abby assisted bank employees with IT support, facilities questions, and HR and other company-related questions. Abby was used with text-based interactions.

By transitioning to Microsoft Copilot Studio, ABN AMRO was able to use [Azure AI Language conversational language understanding](/azure/ai-services/language-service/conversational-language-understanding/overview) (CLU) for intent recognition, a critical factor in accurately interpreting customer and employee requests. The bank replaced its Anna and Abby chatbots with a new Anna and Abby agent experience for customers and employees. The new agents handle more complex queries, provide better service, and reduce operational costs.

## Implementation approach

ABN AMRO created a contact center platform with a Copilot Studio agent in a stepped approach:

1. Migrate the chatbot infrastructure to Copilot Studio.
1. Set up a dialog manager to recognize intents and extract entities.
1. Implement continuous integration and delivery.

### Migrate the chatbot infrastructure to Copilot Studio

ABN AMRO Bank used Copilot Studio to create a new AI-driven, natural-language experience that replaced its chatbots with new Anna and Abby agents. The Abby agent handles internal requests, such as IT Helpdesk support and facilities services.

The Anna agent handles more than 2 million text conversations and 1.5 million voice conversations with customers every year. It covers a wide variety of topics, such as unblocking a debit card, changing the withdrawal limit at an ATM, or navigating ABN AMRO's digital bank services. The following screenshot shows the new Anna agent interface on the bank's customer website:

The bank completed the migration to Copilot Studio in just six months, driven by a successful partnership with Microsoft and [Capgemini](https://www.capgemini.com/). "We helped anchor the partnership with our team and the ABN AMRO team, laying the groundwork for a successful implementation," says Mark Oost, Vice President AI & Generative AI, Insights & Data at Capgemini.

### Use Copilot Studio for intent recognition and entity extraction

Like its predecessor, the new Abby agent supports both text and voice channels. The text channel passes chat interactions from the bank's contact center as a service (CCaaS) platform to Azure middleware. Voice calls are processed in Azure Communication Services before reaching the middleware.

The middleware layer enhances these interactions by using Copilot Studio as the dialog manager, integrated with Azure AI Language CLU for precise intent recognition and entity extraction. Intent recognition helps Anna understand what the customer wants to do. Entity extraction recognizes information in the text or voice interaction and extracts the specific elements that are relevant to the customer's intent.

With Copilot Studio, the conversational IVR on the voice channel understands customer inquiries and routes them to the correct call center department. It also fully resolves certain queries without escalating to a live agent, which enhances ABN AMRO's operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.

The Abby employee agent is generated directly from Copilot Studio and is deployed to the employee portal.

The following diagram shows the integration of Microsoft Copilot Studio with various services for conversational AI and generative AI at ABN AMRO Bank. It includes the following components:

- Anna customer agent: Chat, voice, live agent handoff, CCaaS platform
- Abby employee agent: Chat on employee portal
- Azure AI Language: Intent recognition
- Azure middleware: Message relay and personal data removal
- IVR: Telephony and speech services
- AI-generated answers: GPT models and vector search
- Continuous integration: Azure DevOps
- Analytics: Power BI and Azure Data Lake Storage

### Implement continuous integration and delivery

To support continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD), ABN AMRO uses Azure DevOps with Microsoft Power Platform Build Tools. Copilot Studio agents are solution aware: Components are consolidated into a solution, which is deployed to downstream environments using Azure Pipelines, one of the services in Azure DevOps. This technical setup supports efficient development, testing, and deployment processes, which in turn makes possible rapid and reliable updates. Azure Application Insights provides near real-time technical monitoring of the platform.

The architecture's scalability and integration with advanced AI capabilities allow ABN AMRO to continuously innovate, enhancing its customer-facing and employee-support solutions.
