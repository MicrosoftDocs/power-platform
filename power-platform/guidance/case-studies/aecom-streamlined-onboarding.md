# How AECOM streamlined onboarding with Power Platform and Azure

In this article, you learn from a real-world example how [AECOM](https://aecom.com/), a global leader in infrastructure development, simplifies project onboarding with Power Platform, Microsoft Azure, and Microsoft Fabric. AECOM manages a wide range of projects, including transportation systems, water supply, waste management, energy systems, and public buildings. These projects are significant in scale and complexity, which requires effective coordination across various disciplines and stakeholders.

> I've seen firsthand how the integration of cutting-edge-technology with engineering excellence transform the solutions we deliver to clients.
>
> -*Steve Harrison, Vice President of AECOM MEA's Building Engineering Team*

To automate the process of adding project team members to multiple platforms, AECOM developes the Project Connect application that integrates with SharePoint, Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC), and Revizto. The application ensures that all necessary permissions and access rights are set up correctly from the start, which allows users to avoid interacting with complex data and data sources.

## Challenges

AECOM needed to manage onboarding project members across multiple technology platforms for their complex engineering projects in the Middle East and Africa (MEA) region. As projects grew in scope and complexity, information managers ensured all team members were onboarded to the right technology platform, reducing delays and enabling engineering teams to start work seamlessly and optimize efficiency. A streamlined, centralized solution became critical, especially as more projects came online. Key roles included information managers, designers, and the digital team.

> As a company committed to leveraging Microsoft products, we believe that Microsoft technologies are instrumental in driving our digital transformation journey.
>
> -Martin Angus, AECOM Digital Director of MEA

With the implementation of the Project Connect application, AECOM addressed several challenges that hindered efficiency and productivity:

- **Permission governance:** The dynamic nature of teams spread individuals across various locations and roles. The challenge was ensuring everyone had the right access at the right time.

- **Technological diversity:** Managing permissions for many technologies required continuous learning and implementation. Each technology has unique rules and protocols for access and permissions, adding complexity.

- **Integration deficit:** Operations involve using standard business technologies like Workday and Oracle, as well as platforms like Autodesk, Revizto, and Bluebeam. The lack of integration between these technologies and the team’s permission governance systems added challenges.

- **Decentralized and inefficient technology setup tracking:** Before AECOM implemented Power Platform, tracking technology setups across projects was fragmented and inefficient. Teams relied on manual processes, spreadsheets, and communication channels, leading to gaps in tracking and oversight.

## Solution

The Project Connect application is created using canvas apps, is in production, and is used by all information managers across the MEA region.

Because of its simplicity and positive feedback from users in the MEA region, the application is also deployed in the AECOM Canada region. Further expansion to other regions is expected.

With the Project Connect application, information managers can onboard members to Microsoft Teams and SharePoint through the Project Onboarding Teams screen.

They select the user icon next to the Teams icon to view the user’s permissions analytically. The Teams icon accesses the project’s SharePoint site.

:::image type="content" source="media/aecom-streamlined-onboarding/project-onboarding.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Project Connect application showing the Teams and SharePoint onboarding process." lightbox ="media/aecom-streamlined-onboarding/project-onboarding.png":::

- Information managers start by selecting the desired project (1), which shows a gallery of current members in the middle pane. 
- The information manager can search for a member to see if they already exist in Teams and SharePoint (2). 
- If the member isn’t found, they can be added using the AECOM User Directory by clicking the **Add** icon (3). 
- If the member needs to be included in the Project Management (PM) security group, the administrator can toggle the **PM Security Group** button.
- For adding members in bulk, users can download the Bulk Import Excel sheet template (4). They receive an email with the Excel sheet attached. See the following example email.

:::image type="content" source="media/aecom-streamlined-onboarding/email.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an example email with the Bulk Import Excel sheet template attached." lightbox ="media/aecom-streamlined-onboarding/email.png":::

After filling out the Excel sheet, upload it to the location specified in the email. A Power Automate flow runs in the background to add each member to the project’s SharePoint site.

> [!NOTE]  
> Project Connect includes similar screens for adding users to ACC and Revizto. 

## Project View

The Project View enables information managers to see which technologies a user has access to, such as Teams/SharePoint, ACC, and Revizto. Information managers can:
- Select a project (1)
- Select the \$ icon for the project cost report
- Select a platform logo to access the project on that platform
- Search for a user in the directory (2) to quickly view their technology access.
- Administrators can also add the user to all relevant technologies simultaneously by assigning a role (3) and clicking the **Add** icon (4).

## User View

The User View is the counterpart to the Project View. It allows information managers to:
- Search for a specific user in the AECOM user directory (1) 
- See which technologies they have access to across all projects.

:::image type="content" source="media/aecom-streamlined-onboarding/user-view.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the User View interface showing a search for a specific user and their access to technologies across projects." lightbox = "media/aecom-streamlined-onboarding/user-view.png":::

If an icon appears next to a project name, it indicates that the user has access to that specific technology. A checkmark shows that the user completed onboarding. 

## Admin screen (model-driven app)

The Project Connect Admin screen is created using the Power Apps model-driven app design. The Admin screen lets information managers set up projects for the Project Connect app. Relevant details, like the Revizto Project ID and Autodesk Project ID, are entered on the Admin screen. Afterward, the project is ready for onboarding through the app. 
- To ensure the project is visible in the projects list, the `Project_Onboarding_Setup` field is set to **Yes**.

- **Power Automate:** Power Automate flows retrieve and consolidate information on users assigned to a project across both platforms. These flows use the APIs of Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) and Revizto to onboard members into the respective technology platforms.

- **Power BI:** Provides analytical reports to end users, offering insights into permissions and access levels across different technology platforms for better decision-making and management.

- **Azure Blob Storage:** Stores bulk import templates, such as Excel sheets, used for onboarding users to platforms like Microsoft Teams and SharePoint, ACC, and Revizto.

- **Azure SQL Database:** Houses HRM data from Workday, which is leveraged in Power Apps and the Power Automate flows.

- **Microsoft Fabric:** Facilitates data engineering by consolidating data from multiple sources and storing it in a data warehouse for comprehensive reporting and analysis.

- **Dataverse:** Serves as the backend database for the Project Connect app, storing user information from Microsoft Teams, ACC, and Revizto.

- **Copilot:** Accelerates development by using Copilot capabilities for Dataverse, Power Apps, and Power Automate to streamline workflows and boost productivity.

## Key capabilities

- Onboard users of third-party software, such as ACC and Revizto.

- Bulk onboard users to Microsoft Teams, SharePoint, ACC, and Revizto by using an Excel template.

- Onboard users to three different technology platforms with a single click.

- Use a dashboard to understand permissions analytics across Teams, SharePoint, ACC, and Revizto.

## Architecture diagrams

To understand the technical foundation of the Project Connect application, this article takes a closer look at the solution architecture. The following diagrams show the components and how they interact to deliver an effective onboarding experience.

The first part of the architecture shows how data is automatically extracted from Workday and Workbench platforms to be displayed in Power BI and in Project Connect, which was built using Power Apps.

:::image type="content" source="media/aecom-streamlined-onboarding/architecture.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the architecture diagram showing data flow from Workday and Workbench platforms to Power BI and Project Connect." lightbox = "media/aecom-streamlined-onboarding/architecture.png":::

1.  Copilot capabilities in Power Automate and Power Apps streamline workflows and increase productivity.
2.  Workday sends weekly human resource management (HRM) data to a shared mailbox in Microsoft Outlook.
3.  A Power Automate flow automatically uploads the HR reports into an instance of Azure Blob Storage.
4.  Meanwhile, the Project Cost Control System (from Workbench) sends weekly scheduled project cost reports to the shared Outlook mailbox for all the team’s active projects.
5.  A Power Automate flow also uploads those cost reports to the Azure Blob Storage instance.
6.  Microsoft Fabric Data Factory then ingests the project cost data and HR data into a Fabric Data Warehouse.
7.  Power BI analyzes and visualizes the cost information in a dashboard.
8.  Microsoft Fabric Data Factory ingests the HR data into Azure SQL Database.
9.  The information is then sent from Azure SQL Database to be displayed in the Project Connect application, which was built using Power Apps.
10. The data is then sent to Power BI to be visualized in the dashboard.

Next, let’s take a deeper look at the architecture of the Project Connect application, built using Power Apps.

:::image type="content" source="media/aecom-streamlined-onboarding/architecture-power-apps.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the architecture diagram showing the Project Connect application built using Power Apps." lightbox = "media/aecom-streamlined-onboarding/architecture-power-apps.png":::

1.  Copilot capabilities in Power Automate, Dataverse, and Power Apps streamline workflows and increase productivity.
2.  From the last workflow, the HR data is sent from Azure SQL Database to be displayed in the Project Connect application that was built with Power Apps.
3.  The Project Connect Admin model-driven app directly manages Project Connect.
4.  Access data from the platforms is sent to the Project Connect application:
    - A daily Power Automate flow fetches project user details for all the active Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC) projects, using the ACC API. The data is stored in the AAC Users Dataverse table and sent to the Project Connect application.
    - A second daily Power Automate flow fetches project user details for all the active Revizto projects, using the Revizto API. The data is stored in the Revizto Users Dataverse table and sent to Project Connect.
    - A third daily Power Automate flow fetches user details for all the active Teams projects, using the Microsoft Graph API. The data is stored in the Teams Users Dataverse table and sent along to Project Connect.
5.  Bulk import options let administrators trigger Power Automate flows to send emails to an Outlook inbox with the Excel template, which is then uploaded to SharePoint. When an Excel file is uploaded to SharePoint, that triggers another Power Automate flow to add the users to the specific platform, using the Graph API (for SharePoint and Teams access), the ACC API, or the Revizto API.
6.  Users are added to Teams or SharePoint Group using the Office 365 Groups function.
7.  When adding users to ACC or Revizto, a Power Automate flow stores the user information into the ACC and Revizto Onboarding Tracking tables in Dataverse.
8.  The Project Connect usage data is passed directly into the App Usage Dataverse table.
9.  The table data is analyzed by Fabric Data Factory and ingested into Fabric Data Warehouse.
10. Project information is sent to the Power BI dashboard with the cost information to analyze and visualize project onboarding data.
