# Daimler Truck transforms policy management with Power Apps, Dataverse, and Managed Environments

[Daimler Truck](https://www.daimlertruck.com), one of the world's largest commercial vehicle manufacturers, is modernizing policy management with Microsoft Power Platform.

The company operates globally and focuses on developing, producing, and distributing trucks and buses across various industries. It employs approximately 100,000 people worldwide.

## Challenges

After becoming an independent company, Daimler Truck embraced the opportunity to design a modern set of tools and processes tailored to its evolving needs. The company recognized that the former corporate policy database system no longer aligned with its goals. This recognition led to a focused exploration of the Microsoft Power Platform, unlocking new possibilities for flexibility, productivity, and future-ready operations.

The Policy Navigator project marked an important step as the most comprehensive solution built on Power Platform in the company, designed for all employees. Transitioning to a new platform came with some limitations because certain former processes couldn't be replicated one-to-one.

This shift encouraged the project team to identify opportunities to rethink and improve several process steps, aligning them with the platform's capabilities and the company's evolving needs.

## Solution

Daimler Truck addressed the challenge of creating a new independent database system by using Power Platform's low-code development capabilities, collaboration tools, and cost efficiency. The data is stored in Microsoft Dataverse, a unified and scalable data platform that offers security, compliance, and deep integration across the Microsoft ecosystem. This strategic adoption aligns with the company's digital roadmap, which is aimed at fostering scalability, operational efficiency, and innovation.

Employees across the organization use the Policy Navigator app, achieving company-wide adoption of Power Platform.

The app features an intuitive and user-focused interface. For everyday users, the Power Apps canvas app provides seamless navigation and self-service capabilities, enabling efficient interaction with corporate policies. Simultaneously, the Power Apps model-driven app offers a powerful backend for administrators to manage policy lifecycles and ensure governance compliance. These dual applications address both user accessibility and operational governance, creating a comprehensive solution tailored to diverse organizational needs.

Cost efficiency is another key benefit of the Policy Navigator app. By using existing enterprise-wide Power Apps licenses, the app avoids additional licensing costs. It replaces the former system with a scalable and agile solution, driving cost savings. Additionally, its intuitive design has led to a higher adoption rate than previous solutions.  

## Components

The Policy Navigator app includes three components:  

- **Power Apps canvas app**: Enables internal employees to search, filter, find, and read corporate policies.
- **Power Apps model-driven app**: Enables administrators to track each policy's lifecycle, from draft to publication, including versioning and minor changes.
- **SharePoint**: Provides a folder system for collaboration on policy files.

### Canvas app user experience

Employees access corporate policies via the canvas app. Information is presented in a modern, user-friendly format that streamlines readability and usability.

User-focused features further enhance the app's value. Advanced filtering options allow employees to search for corporate policies by department, region, plant ID, and business role, with the goal to provide quick and relevant access to information. The app also includes a policy request feature, enabling employees to suggest new corporate policies directly within the system through a structured process.

The following image shows the Policy Navigator Home page, where the user can browse, search, and filter policies.

The following image shows a policy detail page with a description of the policy, detailed information, and links to related documents.

The policy detail page includes the "Keep Me Posted" feature, which enables real-time notifications about policy updates. This feature strengthens engagement and supports greater transparency across the organization.

### Model-driven admin app

The following image shows the model-driven application. It enables administrators to add new policies or edit existing ones.

The following images show the policy creation process, where administrators set permissions and make further changes.

For policy updates, the app streamlines processes by enabling minor revisions without creating new versions. It maintains structured workflows for major updates to ensure clarity and communication with stakeholders.

### Governance

Governance is a key focus area. Daimler Truck has established a specialized global delivery team to drive operational maturity with Power Platform Managed Environments. The organization has cultivated a thriving low-code ecosystem, with over 8,000 makers driving innovation and 1,400 active apps in production.

The company launched the Policy Navigator app and activated over 4,000 Power Platform Managed Environments to ensure they use the latest capabilities to help keep their tenant secure.

## Key takeaways

Operational efficiency has improved significantly, simplifying policy access and saving valuable time and resources across the organization. The app has also facilitated collaboration among Daimler Truck's globally distributed teams responsible for corporate policies and works agreements. Transitioning from the former system to a low-code solution has also optimized costs and reinforced the company's commitment to technology-driven transformation.

This case study demonstrates the potential of using Power Apps, Dataverse, and Managed Environments to build a policy exploration and administration application. It also shows how organizations can scale their impact by enabling hundreds of employees to create their own low-code applications to increase productivity. Using a model-driven application as the backend and a canvas app as the frontend is a creative approach that unlocks many possibilities.

Here are some key takeaways:

- Achieve operational efficiency
- Save time and resources
- Automate core processes
- Foster cross-organizational collaboration
- Optimize and reduce system and resource costs
- Establish a forward-thinking reputation through technological innovation

The project streamlined policy management, reduced costs, and enhanced collaboration. As the organization continues to integrate AI technologies and scale its governance frameworks, it's well-positioned to lead in using low-code platforms to drive business innovation and value. This solution highlights the company's commitment to adapting, innovating, and thriving in an increasingly dynamic, digital business environment.

## Looking ahead

Daimler Truck is currently exploring how artificial intelligence can enhance the Policy Navigator app. The company is testing AI-powered automation to help employees quickly locate relevant corporate policies and better understand their content.

Daimler Truck's Power Platform journey demonstrates its commitment to using cutting-edge technologies, both as a productivity tool and a strategic asset in reshaping its digital future.
