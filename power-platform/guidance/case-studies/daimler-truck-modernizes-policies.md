# Daimler Truck modernizes policies with Power Platform

[Daimler Truck](https://www.daimlertruck.com), one of the world's
largest commercial vehicle manufacturers, is modernizing policy
management with Microsoft Power Platform and Dataverse.

The company operates globally, focusing on the development, production,
and distribution of trucks and buses across various industries. The
company employs around 100,000 people worldwide.

## Challenges

After becoming an independent company, Daimler Truck embraced the
opportunity to design a modern set of tools and processes tailored to
its evolving needs. The company recognized that the former corporate policy
database system no longer aligned with its goals. This recognition led to a
focused exploration of the Microsoft Power Platform, unlocking new
possibilities for flexibility, productivity, and future-ready
operations.

The project Policy Navigator marked an important step as the most
comprehensive solution built on Microsoft Power Platform in the company,
designed for all employees. Transitioning to a new platform came with
some limitations as certain former processes couldn't be replicated
one-to-one.

This shift also encouraged the project team to identify opportunities to
rethink and improve several process steps, making them more aligned with
the platform's capabilities and the company's evolving needs.

## Solution

In response to the challenge of establishing a new, independent database
system, Daimler Truck uses Power Platform's low-code development
capabilities, robust collaboration tools, and cost-efficiency. The data
is stored in Microsoft Dataverse, a unified and scalable data platform
that offers security, compliance, and deep integration across the
Microsoft ecosystem. This strategic adoption aligns with the company's
digital roadmap, which is aimed at fostering scalability, operational
efficiency, and innovation.

The Policy Navigator App is used by employees throughout the company,
acting as an achievement the company-wide adoption of Power Platform.

The app is designed with an intuitive and user-focused interface. For
everyday users, the Power Apps canvas app provides seamless navigation
and self-service capabilities, enabling efficient interaction with
corporate policies. Simultaneously, the Power Apps model-driven app
offers a powerful backend for administrators to manage policy lifecycles
and ensure governance compliance. These dual applications address both
user accessibility and operational governance that create a comprehensive
solution which is tailored to diverse organizational needs.

Cost efficiency is another benefit of the Policy Navigator App. By
utilizing existing enterprise-wide Power Apps licenses, additional
licensing costs were avoided. The app also replaces the former system
with a scalable, agile solution, which drives additional cost savings.
Because the app is intuitive, it benefits from a higher adoption
rate than previous solutions.

### Components

The Policy Navigator App has three components:

- **Power Apps canvas app**: This application enables users (internal
  employees) to search, filter, find, and read the policies.

- **Power Apps model-driven app**: This application enables
  administrators to track each policy's lifecycle, from draft to
  publication. The app includes information about the new policy
  versions and when minor changes are made.

- **SharePoint**: A folder system for collaboration on the
  policy files.

### User application implemented with canvas app

Employees can access the different corporate policies via this app, presented in a modern, user-friendly format that streamlines the readability and usability.

A host of user-centric functionalities further enhance the app's value.
Advanced filtering options allow employees to search for corporate
policies by department, region, plant ID, or business role, which
ensures quick and relevant access to information. The app also includes
a policy request feature, enabling employees to suggest new corporate
policies directly within the system through a structured process.

The following image shows the Policy Navigator Home page, where the user can
browse, search and filter policies.

The following image displays a policy detail page, providing a clear
description of the policy along with comprehensive information and
direct access to related documents.

Furthermore, the policy detail page includes the "Keep Me Posted"
feature, which enables real-time notifications about policy updates.
This helps strengthen engagement and supports greater transparency
throughout the organization.

### Administrative model-driven app

The following image shows the administrative model-driven application,
which allows administrators to add new policies or edit existing
policies.

The following illustrations show policy creation process, where
administrators can set permissions and make further
changes.

For policy updates, the app streamlines processes by enabling minor
revisions without requiring new version creation. The app maintains
structured workflows for major updates to ensure clarity and
communication across stakeholders.

### Governance

Governance has been a key area of focus, with Daimler Truck establishing
a specialized global delivery team to drive operational maturity with
Power Platform Managed Environments. The organization has cultivated a
thriving low-code ecosystem, with over 8,000 makers driving innovation
and putting over 1,400 active apps in production.

The company established the Policy Navigator App and activated over
4,000 Power Platform Managed Environments to make sure they use the
latest and greatest capabilities that help keep their tenant secure.

## Key takeaways

Operational efficiency has improved significantly, simplifying policy
access and saving valuable time and resources across the organization.
The app has also facilitated collaboration among Daimler Truck's
globally distributed responsibilities for corporate policies and works
agreements. Transitioning from the former system to a low-code solution
has also optimized costs, reinforcing the company's commitment to
technology-driven transformation.

The case study of Daimler Truck's Policy Navigator App demonstrates the
potential of using Power Apps, Dataverse, and Managed Environments to
build a policy exploration and administration application, and it
demonstrates the opportunity to scale the impact by enabling hundreds of
their employees to create their own low-code applications to increase
productivity. Also, the idea of using a model-driven application as
backend and a canvas app as frontend is creative and opens up many possibilities.

Here are some key takeaways:

- Achieve operational efficiency.

- Save time and resources.

- Automation of core processes.

- Foster cross-organizational collaboration.

- Optimize and reduce system and resource costs.

- Establish and grow a forward-thinking reputation that embraces
  opportunities from technological innovations.

The project enabled to streamline policy management, reduce costs, and
enhancing collaboration. As the organization continues to integrate AI
technologies and scale its governance frameworks, it's well-positioned
to lead in using low-code platforms to drive business innovation
and value. This solution underscores the company's commitment to
adapting, innovating, and thriving in an increasingly dynamic and
digital business environment.

## Looking ahead

Daimler Truck is exploring how artificial intelligence can
enhance the Policy Navigator App. The company is testing AI-powered automation
to help employees quickly locate relevant corporate policies and better
understand their content.

Daimler Truck's Power Platform journey shows its strong commitment
to use cutting-edge technologies, both as a productivity tool and
as a strategic asset in reshaping its digital future.
