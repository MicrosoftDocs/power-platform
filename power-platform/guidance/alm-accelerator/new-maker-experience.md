## Walk-through: ALM Accelerator new maker experience

The ALM Accelerator administration app was used to configure the following user experience. The administrator app is installed with the ALM Accelerator. [Learn how to use the administration app to configure and share experiences](setup-deployment-user-profiles.md).

### Start the ALM Accelerator new maker experience

1. Select **Apps** > **ALM Accelerator for Power Platform**.

1. Create connections and grant consent when prompted.

1. If prompted to create an HTTP with Microsoft Entra connection, enter `https://graph.microsoft.com` for both the **Base Resource URL** and **Azure AD Resource URI**.

1. Select **Create** for each connection when prompted.

1. The first time you open the app, select an environment.

   The next time you open the app, it remembers which environment you were working in.

   A list of the unmanaged solutions in the environment appears. Depending on your user deployment settings, the following options are available for each solution:

    - **Save Solution**: Saves the current state of the solution into version control so that all changes made to it can be tracked. Deployment pipelines are created as part of the save process.
    - **Publish Solution**: Allows you to request to move the solution across environments.
    - **Choose a Profile**: Allows you to associate a solution with a solution profile. If you're unsure what profile to select, ask your administrator for the name of the profile for your solution.
    - **Request History** (**>**): Lists saves and deployments requested and completed for the solution.

### Configure deployment settings

1. Find your solution in the list and select **Choose a Profile**. Your selection determines which environments you can deploy the solution to.

1. Select a profile, and then select **Save**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you don't find a solution profile that suits your needs, ask your administrator to create one for you.

1. Under the name of the solution, select **Configure Deployment Settings**.

1. Configure the following settings:

   - **Deployment Environment List**

     - The environments in the list are the ones that are specified in the solution profile. They correspond with the environments in which your solution is available after you publish. Select an environment to deploy the solution to.

   - **Connection References**

      :::image type="content" source="media/aa4pp-deployment-settings-connection-references.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Connection Reference configuration in the ALM Accelerator.":::

      - All the connection references in your solution are listed. Users can create connections in their downstream environments to hook up the connection references in the target environment.
      - If you have permissions to create connections in the target environment, the **+** button is displayed. To create a connection, select **+**. After you create a connection, select **Refresh** in the upper-right corner to update the list.
        - To select a connection in the target environment, select a connection in the list.
        - To open the connection in the target environment, select the connection's name or status.
      - If you don't have permission to create connections in the target environment, the **+** button is disabled. Ask another user to create the connection for you:
         - Select **Request a Connection**.
         - Enter the name of the team member you need to create the connection, and then select the user.
         - To open the preformatted email, select **Send**.
         The preformatted email includes a link for the recipient to create the connection.

   - **Environment Variables**

      :::image type="content" source="media/aa4pp-deployment-settings-environment-vars.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Environment Variables configuration in the ALM Accelerator.":::

      - All the environment variables in your solution are listed. Users can set the value of the environment variables in their downstream environments.
      - For standard environment variables like string, number, and JSON, enter the value in the text box to the right of the variable name.
      - For data source environment variables, use the dropdown lists to select the appropriate data source to use in the downstream environment.

   - **Canvas Apps**

      :::image type="content" source="media/aa4pp-deployment-settings-app-sharing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of App Sharing configuration in the ALM Accelerator.":::<!-- EDITOR'S NOTE: Please crop the screenshot IAW our [screenshot guidelines](/bacx/screenshots-for-bap?branch=main) -->

      - All the apps in your solution are listed. Users can share them in their downstream environments with a Microsoft Entra group.
      - Use the dropdown list to select the **Azure AAD group** with which you'd like to share the app.
      - To view the group details, select **Details**. A new browser tab opens with a link to the Microsoft Entra group in the Azure portal.
      - Use the permissions dropdown list to set the permissions to **Can View**, **Can Edit**, or **Can View and Share**.

   - **Group Teams**

      - To add a new Group Team configuration, select **'+'**. Enter a **Team Name**, select an **AAD Group** that the team should be linked to, and select **Security Roles** as required. The list of security roles is based on the roles available in the selected development environment. Add any custom security roles to the solution to make sure they're available in the target environment.

   - **Flows**

      :::image type="content" source="media/aa4pp-deployment-settings-flows.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Flow configuration in the ALM Accelerator.":::<!-- EDITOR'S NOTE: Please crop the screenshot IAW our [screenshot guidelines](/bacx/screenshots-for-bap?branch=main) -->

      - All the flows in your solution are listed. Users can configure the owner of the flow, Dataverse Team sharing, the user with which to activate the flow, whether a flow should be activated or not, and the sequence of flow activation in their downstream environments.
      - To view the flow, select its name. The flow definition opens in a new browser tab.
      - Use the **Owner** list to select a Dataverse user to own the flow in the downstream environment.
      - Use the **Team Sharing** list to select the Dataverse Team to share the flow to. The list includes Dataverse Teams in the downstream environment and Dataverse Teams that are configured in the Group Teams settings.
      - Use the **Activation User** list to select the user to activate the flow.
      - In the **Flows to Activate and Order** column, select the checkbox to indicate whether a flow should be activated or not.

### Save and deploy the solution

1. Publish any changes to your app.

1. Select **Save Solution** to push your changes to Git.

   Be sure to publish any app changes before you start a save.

   In the background, the app pushes your change to version control, automatically creating a branch. Repeat the pushes as you make changes to your solution to preserve your change history.

   During this step, you're asked to [configure the deployment settings](#configure-deployment-settings).

   A waiting indicator appears when the push begins. When the push succeeds, a checkbox appears. A red **X** indicates the push failed.

1. When you're ready to deploy your changes across other environments, select **Deploy Solution**.

1. Enter a **Title** and **Notes** for the pull request that's created in Azure DevOps.

1. Select an **Environment** to deploy the solution to.

   Depending on the **Solution Profile** configuration, the application either creates a pull request that needs to be completed in Azure DevOps or triggers a pipeline that someone must approve before it can run and complete the publishing.

   When the progress indicator appears, it means the deployment has started. Select the right angle bracket (**>**) to visualize the request history.
