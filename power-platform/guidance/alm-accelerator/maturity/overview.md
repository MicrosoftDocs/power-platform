# ALM adoption maturity model

Use the levels and capabilities in the [Power Platform adoption maturity model](../../adoption/maturity-model.md) to evaluate your organization's usage of application lifecycle management (ALM) and how the ALM Accelerator for Power Platform can help.

## Quick start

The ALM Accelerator is a good match when you can verify that the following considerations apply to your organization.

1. What is the impact of the solution?
   - Are the applications classified as critical or high [business impact](#business-impact)?
   - Who is using the application?
      - Is it a productivity application used by everyone in your organization?
      - Is it used by senior leadership to make business-impact decisions?
      - Is it integrated with external users; for example, partners and customers who rely on the solution as part of an external process?
   - Are there specific compliance and auditing needs?
      - How important is tracking and auditing who is using the application?
      - Does the solution have compliance and auditing requirements?

1. Do you have the prerequisites in place?
   - Do you have a defined environment strategy for development, validation, test, and production?
   - Do you use Azure DevOps Services or can you integrate with Azure DevOps Services for source control and build pipelines?

     - Do you have Basic or above Azure DevOps licenses for makers?
     - Do you have Per App or Per User Power Apps licenses to access the ALM Accelerator maker solution?

1. Are you looking to move to Level 300 - Defined or beyond?

1. Do you have an environment strategy in place?
    - What is the request strategy for environments?
      - Do you have a process to create development, test, and production environments?
      - Is the process to request environments automated?

1. Do you understand and have you implemented source control concepts?
    - Is [branching and merging](/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance) understood?
    - Are [pull requests](/azure/devops/repos/git/git-branching-guidance?#review-and-merge-code-with-pull-requests) used to review and merge changes?
    - Are [build pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/key-pipelines-concepts) used to integrate and deploy between validation, test, and production environments?

1. Are [fusion development](/learn/paths/transform-business-applications-with-fusion-development/) teams engaged to include low-code and pro-code teams?

1. Are your professional development teams familiar with branching and merging strategies and able to assist makers?

1. Do your pro-code and operations teams manage Azure Pipelines?

1. Are you a pro-code team creating components in JavaScript?

1. Are you integrating with OpenAPI-enabled Web APIs?

1. Are you using or planning to create [plug-ins](/powerapps/developer/data-platform/plug-ins) to extend business processes in Microsoft Dataverse?

1. Do you have a support plan?
   - Who is supporting the application and solution?
   - Do you have a formal support team to manage issues with the solution?
