# Upgrade the ALM Accelerator

We periodically release updates of the ALM Accelerator for Power Platform. When a new version of the solution is available, follow the steps in this article to upgrade it. Upgrade the pipeline templates separately using the [pipeline sync template](setup-pipeline-sync.md) that's included with the ALM Accelerator solution.

Don't use these instructions to install the ALM Accelerator for the first time. Instead, follow one of these guides:

- [Configure the ALM Accelerator using the admin app](setup-admin-tasks.md)
- [Configure the ALM Accelerator manually](setup-components-manually.md)

## Download the latest release

The solution version number indicates the date of the release. For example, version *1.0.20220406.1* means version 1.0, created on 20220406 (yyyyMMdd), or April 6, 2022.

Download the latest managed solution file from [GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-starter-kit/releases). Scroll down to **Assets** and select *CenterofExcellenceALMAccelerator_\<latest version\>_managed.zip*.
