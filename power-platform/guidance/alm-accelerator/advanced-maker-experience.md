## Walk-through: ALM Accelerator advanced maker experience

The ALM Accelerator administration app was used to configure the following user experience. The administrator app is installed with the ALM Accelerator. [Learn how to use the administration app to configure and share experiences](setup-deployment-user-profiles.md).

### Start the ALM Accelerator advanced maker experience

1. Select **Apps** > **ALM Accelerator for Power Platform**.

1. Create connections and grant consent when prompted.

1. If you're prompted to create an HTTP with Microsoft Entra connection, enter *https://graph.microsoft.com* for both the **Base Resource URL** and **Azure AD Resource URI**.

1. Select **Create** for each connection when prompted.

1. The first time you open the app, select an environment.

   The next time you open the app, it remembers which environment you were working in.

   A list of the unmanaged solutions in the environment appears. Depending on your user deployment settings, the following options are available for each solution:

   - **Commit Solution**: Commits all the changes you've made in the solution to your version control system. Deployment pipelines are created as part of the commit process.
   - **Deploy Solution**: Allows you to move the changes across environments.
   - **Choose a Profile**: Allows you to configure what organization, project, repository, target branch, and environments your solution can be deployed to.
   - **Delete Solution**: Deletes the solution. If necessary, import it again from source control with the latest changes.
   - **Import Solution**: Imports an unmanaged solution into your maker environment from source control.
   - **Request History** (**>**): Lists commits and deployments requested and completed for the solution.

### Select a deployment profile for a solution

Create a solution in the Power Apps design studio or import an unmanaged solution from an Azure DevOps project. Then choose a profile to associate the solution with a specific organization, project, repository, target branch, and environments where you can deploy it.

1. To import a solution, select **Import Solution**, and then select a **Profile**, **Solution Source**, **Solution Folder**, and **Configuration**.

   - **Profile**: Points to an organization and project in Azure DevOps.

   - **Solution Source**: Select the branch in Azure DevOps that contains the project you selected in the configuration.

   - **Solution Folder**: From the list of folders in the selected branch that contain a **SolutionPackage folder** from a previous export, select the one that contains your solution.

   - **Configuration** (Optional): Select a directory under the config directory in the **Solution Folder** that contains deployment settings and configuration data. [Learn more about deployment configuration settings](setup-data-deployment-configuration.md).

   You're either pulling the latest changes from the solution branch or pulling another maker's branch into your environment. The **Configuration** setting makes sure that all the necessary post-solution import configuration data exists in your environment.

> Using the progress icons to visualize what's happening in the pipelines in Azure DevOps can be disabled for makers.

### Deploy the solution

1. When you're ready to deploy your changes across other environments, select **Deploy Solution**.

1. Depending on your permissions, you may be able to select **Advanced Settings**, specify the **Source** and **Target** branch, and enter a **Title** and **Comment** for your pull request. If you don't have those permissions, select an environment to deploy to.

1. Select **Deploy Solution**.

1. The next steps depend on the approval type of the deployment step.

     - **Pull Request:** A pull request is created for your changes. The remaining steps to merge and release to the test environment occur in Azure DevOps. Depending on the branch policies and triggers configured for your target branch, an Azure DevOps user can approve or reject your pull request based on their findings in the submitted changes. The status of the pull request appears in the app.

     - **Environment:** The pipeline to deploy the solution to the target environment is triggered. The remaining approval steps occur in Azure DevOps.

1. To initiate a solution upgrade in the target environment, add the **solution-upgrade** tag to a pull request.

   The deployment of your solution to the selected environment starts with the approval of the pull request or the pipeline execution, depending on the approval type. When the progress indicator appears, it means the deployment has started. Select the right angle bracket (**>**) to visualize the request history.

   :::image type="content" source="media/aa4pp-request-history.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the request history of a solution in the ALM Accelerator.":::
