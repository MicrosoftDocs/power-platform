# Configure the ALM Accelerator manually

You can configure the components of the ALM Accelerator for Power Platform either using the accompanying [administration app](setup-admin-tasks.md) or manually. This article guides you through configuring the app manually and is structured in seven sections:

- [**Prerequisites**](#prerequisites)
- [**Foundational setup**](#foundational-setup)
- [**Development project setup**](#development-project-setup)
- [**Solution setup**](#solution-setup)
- [**Import the solution and configure the app**](#import-the-solution-and-configure-the-app)
- [**Set up makers to use the ALM Accelerator app**](#set-up-makers-to-use-the-alm-accelerator-app)

## Prerequisites

Before you install the ALM Accelerator for Power Platform, make sure you've met the following prerequisites.

- The ALM Accelerator must be installed in a Power Platform environment that has a Microsoft Dataverse database. All the environments you use the ALM Accelerator to deploy solutions to also require a Dataverse database.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The ALM Accelerator isn't compatible with Dataverse for Teams. Both the ALM Accelerator app and the associated pipelines assume that you're using the full version of Dataverse in all environments.

  We recommend you install the ALM Accelerator in the same environment as other CoE Starter Kit solutions. Learn more about how to determine the best strategy for your organization:

  - [Establishing an environment strategy for Microsoft Power Platform](../adoption/environment-strategy.md)
  - [Environment strategy for ALM](../../alm/environment-strategy-alm.md)

- The ALM Accelerator uses Azure DevOps for source control and deployments. If you don't have an Azure DevOps organization, sign up for free for up to five users on the [Azure DevOps site](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/DevOps/).

- To complete the steps in this section, you need the following users and permissions in Azure, Azure DevOps, and Power Platform:

  - A licensed Azure user with permissions to create and view Microsoft Entra groups, create app registrations, and grant admin consent to app registrations in Microsoft Entra ID
  - A licensed Azure DevOps user with permissions to create and manage pipelines, service connections, repos, and extensions
  - A licensed Power Platform user with permissions to create application users and grant them administrative permissions

- The following connectors must be available to be used together in the environment into which the ALM Accelerator is imported:

  - [Dataverse (legacy)](/connectors/commondataservice/)
  - HTTP
  - [Power Apps for Makers](/connectors/powerappsforappmakers/)
  - [HTTP with Microsoft Entra ID](/connectors/webcontents/) (with endpoint access to <https://graph.microsoft.com>)
  - ALM Accelerator Custom DevOps (this connector is created as part of the [accelerator solution import](#import-the-solution-and-configure-the-app))
  - [Office 365 Users](/connectors/office365users/)
  - HTTP

- [Install the Creator Kit](/power-platform/guidance/creator-kit/setup) in the environment where you install the ALM Accelerator.

## Foundational setup

The following steps are general to the functionality of the ALM Accelerator and aren't specific to any project or solution.

### Create an app registration in your Microsoft Entra environment

Create an app registration for the ALM Accelerator to grant the app and associated pipelines permissions required to perform operations in Azure DevOps and Power Apps or Dataverse. You only need to do this once.

The following steps show how to create a single app registration with permissions for both Dataverse and Azure DevOps. However, you might want to create separate app registrations to divide responsibilities. You should [consider how separate app registrations affect both maintenance and security](app-registration-strategy.md) before you decide on an app registration strategy.

#### Create the app registration

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. Select **Microsoft Entra ID** > **App registrations**.

1. Select **+ New registration**, and then give the registration a name, such as *ALMAcceleratorServicePrincipal*.

1. Leave all other options at their default values, and select **Register**.

#### Add permissions to the app registration

1. In the left side panel, select **API permissions**.

1. Select **+ Add a permission**.

1. Select **Dynamics CRM**, and then select **Delegated permissions** and **user_impersonation**.

1. Select **Add permissions** to add the Dynamics CRM API user_impersonation permission to the app registration.

1. Select **+ Add a permission** again.

1. Select the **APIs my organization uses** tab. Search for and select **PowerApps-Advisor**, and then select **Delegated permissions** and **Analysis.All** (admin consent not required).

    This permission is required to run static analysis through the [app checker](../../alm/checker-api/overview.md).

1. Select **Add permissions** to add the PowerApps-Advisor API Analysis.All permission to the app registration.

1. Select **+ Add a permission** again.

1. On either the **Microsoft APIs** tab or the **APIs my organization uses** tab, select **Azure DevOps**, and then select **Delegated permissions** and **user_impersonation**.

    This permission is required for connecting to Azure DevOps through the custom connector in the ALM Accelerator app.

1. If you added the Azure DevOps permission from the **APIs my organization uses** tab, copy the **Application (client) ID** for use later in this procedure.

   You'll use it as the **DevOps Application (client) ID**, which is different from the **Application (client) ID** you'll copy later in this procedure.

    If you can't find the Azure DevOps permission on the **APIs my organization uses** tab, follow these steps to get the **DevOps Application (client) ID**:

      1. Open a private browser window and go to `https://dev.azure.com/<your devops organization>/_apis`.
      1. On the sign-in page, copy the value of the **client_id** parameter in the URL.

      :::image type="content" source="media/almacceleratorpowerplatform-components/aa4pp-devops-clientid.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an Azure DevOps organization sign-in page, with the client_id parameter in the URL highlighted.":::<!-- EDITOR'S NOTE: Please crop the screenshot IAW our [screenshot guidelines](/bacx/screenshots-for-bap?branch=main) -->

1. Select **Add permissions** to add the Azure DevOps API user_impersonation permission to the app registration.

1. Select **Grant admin consent for \<*your tenant*\>**.

#### Configure the client secret and redirect URI

1. In the left side panel, select **Certificates & secrets**.

1. Select **+ New client secret**.

1. Select an expiration date, and then select **Add**.

1. Copy the client secret **Value** for use later. *This is the only time you can copy the value.* Be sure to do so before you leave the page.

1. In the left side panel, select **Overview**.

1. Copy the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**.

1. Select **Add a Redirect URI**.

1. Select **+ Add a Platform**, and then select **Web**.

1. For the redirect URI of the application, enter *`https://global.consent.azure-apim.net/redirect`*.

    You might need to change this value after you install the ALM Accelerator app and configure the Azure DevOps custom connector. If the redirect URI that's populated in the custom connector is different from what you enter here, change this URI to match the one in the custom connector.

1. Select **Configure**.

### Give Power App Management permission to your app registration

Grant [Power App Management](/powershell/module/microsoft.powerapps.administration.powershell/new-powerappmanagementapp) permissions to your app registration so that the pipelines can perform the actions they need to in your environments. To do that, run the following PowerShell cmdlet as an interactive user that has Power Apps administrative privileges. You only need to run this command once, after you create your app registration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The following PowerShell cmdlet gives the app registration elevated permissions like Power Platform Admin. Your organization's security policies may not allow these types of permissions. Make sure they're allowed before you continue. If they aren't allowed, certain capabilities don't work in the ALM Accelerator pipelines.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.Administration.PowerShell
Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerApps.PowerShell -AllowClobber
New-PowerAppManagementApp -ApplicationId <the Application (client) ID you copied when you created the app registration>
```

### Install Azure DevOps extensions

The ALM Accelerator uses several Azure DevOps extensions, including some third-party extensions that are available in the Azure DevOps marketplace. The website of each third-party extension and a link to their source code are provided in the following instructions. [Learn how to evaluate a Marketplace extension publisher](/azure/devops/marketplace/trust).

1. Sign in to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com).

1. Select **Organization settings**.

1. Select **General** > **Extensions**.

1. Search for and install the following extensions:

   - **Power Platform Build Tools (required)**: This extension contains the Microsoft build tasks for Power Platform. (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=microsoft-IsvExpTools.PowerPlatform-BuildTools>)

   - **Replace Tokens (required)**: The pipelines use this extension to replace tokens in configuration files and store secure values in private variables configured for a pipeline. (<https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=qetza.replacetokens> | <https://github.com/qetza/vsts-replacetokens-task>)

   - **SARIF SAST Scans Tab (optional)**: Use this extension to visualize the SARIF files the solution checker generates during a build. ([SARIF SAST Scans Tab - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sariftools.scans))

      :::image type="content" source="media/almacceleratorpowerplatform-components/image-20210217102344719.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the SARIF SAST Scans tab in Azure DevOps.":::<!-- EDITOR'S NOTE: Please crop and rename the screenshot IAW our [screenshot guidelines](/bacx/screenshots-for-bap?branch=main) -->

<a name="clone-the-yaml-pipelines-from-github-to-your-devops-instance"></a>

### Clone the YAML pipelines from GitHub to your Azure DevOps instance

1. Go to [https://aka.ms/coe-alm-accelerator-templates-latest-release](https://aka.ms/coe-alm-accelerator-templates-latest-release) and copy the URL of the most recent release.

1. Sign in to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/).

1. Create a project or select an existing project.

1. Select **Repos**, and then select **Import repository** in the repository list.

1. Paste the URL you copied in step 1 as the **Clone URL**, and then select **Import**.

1. Confirm the default branch for the repo is *main*. Select **Repos** and **Branches** and make sure the *main* branch is tagged as the default.

   If it isn't, select the three vertical dots (**&vellip;**) corresponding to the *main* branch, and from the **More options** menu, select **Set as default branch**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This repo is where the solution pipeline templates and the export/import pipelines run. Later, when you create the pipelines for your solutions, you might need to refer to this specific project and repo if you choose to use a different repo for source control for your solutions.

### Create pipelines for import, delete, and export of solutions

Create import, delete, and export pipelines based on the YAML in the Azure DevOps repo. These pipelines run when you use the app to commit a solution to Git, import a solution, or delete a solution.

> [!NOTE]
> If you expect all your exports to perform the same actions regardless of the solution for which the pipeline is running, you can create a single export pipeline as described in this section. However, you might need different export actions based on the solution. In that case, you can append the solution name to the export-solution-to-git pipeline, like *export-solution-to-git-SampleSolution*, to have the app execute your specific solution pipelines when you perform the actions in the app.

The following table shows the correspondence between the YAML file in the repo and its accompanying pipeline.

| YAML file | Pipeline name |
| --------- | ------------- |
| export-solution-to-git.yml |export-solution-to-git |
| import-unmanaged-to-dev-environment.yml | import-unmanaged-to-dev-environment |
| delete-unmanaged-solution-and-components.yml | delete-unmanaged-solution-and-components |

1. In Azure DevOps, go to **Pipelines** > **Create a New Pipeline**.

1. Select **Azure Repos Git** for your code repository, and then point to the Azure DevOps repo you created and seeded with the pipeline templates in the earlier steps.

1. On the **Configure your pipeline** page, select **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file** and point to **/Pipelines/export-solution-to-git.yml**, **/Pipelines/import-unmanaged-to-dev-environment.yml** or **/Pipelines/delete-unmanaged-solution-and-components.yml**.

1. Select **Continue**, and then select **Save**.

1. Select the **More** menu (**&hellip;**) next to **Run Pipeline**, and then select **Rename/Move**.

1. Change the pipeline name to **export-solution-to-git**, **import-unmanaged-to-dev-environment**, or **delete-unmanaged-solution-and-components**, as appropriate.

1. Select **Save**.

### Create export pipeline variables (optional)

You may set pipeline variables on the export-solution-to-git pipeline to control what information is persisted to source control. To apply these settings globally, set the variables on your export-solution-to-git pipeline. To apply the settings to specific solutions on export, create an export pipeline for your solution as described in the note in the previous section, and set the variables on that pipeline.

To make sure the current values of environment variables are never committed to source control during the export process, create the `DoNotExportCurrentEnvironmentVariableValues` variable on your export-solution-to-git pipeline and set its value to True.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This pipeline variable is recommended so that you can use the deployment configuration functionality in the ALM Accelerator.

To make sure the values of specific default environment variables are set during the export of a solution, create the `VerifyDefaultEnvironmentVariableValues` variable on your export-solution-to-git pipeline and set its value to True. Set the values of default environment variables in the customDeploymentSettings.json as described in the [deployment configuration guide](setup-data-deployment-configuration.md).

1. In Azure DevOps, select **Pipelines** > **Library** > **Create a new Variable Group**.<!-- EDITOR'S NOTE: Please confirm the capitalization in the UI. -->

1. Name the new variable group *alm-accelerator-variable-group*, exactly as given here.

   The pipelines refer to this specific variable group, so it must be named exactly as shown. If you decide to use a different naming convention for your variable group, you need to modify parts of the pipelines to refer to the name you use instead.

1. Add the following variables to the variable group:

    | Name | Description | Value |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | AADHost | The Microsoft Entra authorization endpoint | For public clouds, use *login.microsoftonline.com*. For government clouds, use the appropriate authorization URL. |
    | ProcessCanvasApps | Whether canvas apps are unpacked during export or packed during builds | If False, then the canvas apps aren't unpacked during export or packed during builds. The [canvas app unpack and pack functionality is in preview](https://aka.ms/paccanvas) and isn't recommended for use in production environments at this time. However, you can't view canvas source code in source control unless you set this variable to True. |

1. (**Optional**) If you use canvas studio test automation in your pipelines, add the following variables to the variable group:

    | Name | Value |
    | --- | --- |
    | TestAutomationLoginMethod | *CloudIdentity* |
    | TestAutomationMakerPortalUrl | The URL from the Power Apps maker portal, typically `*https://make.powerapps.com*` |
    | TestAutomationUsername | The user account used to execute the automated tests |
    | TestAutomationPassword | The password for the user account used to execute the automated tests |

1. (**Optional**) By default, the global variables are restricted and you need to configure access for each pipeline. You can simplify that and allow access for any pipeline. Under the **Variable group** (**Pipelines** > **Library** > **alm-accelerator-variable-group**), select **Pipeline permissions** in the top menu, select (**&hellip;**), and then select **Open access**.

### Set permissions for the project build service

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Azure DevOps contains a number of "Build Service" accounts, and it might be confusing as you follow the steps in this section. Pay close attention to the names and format specified in steps 3 and 5. You might need to search for the specific account if it doesn't show up in the initial list.

1. In Azure DevOps, select **Project settings**.

1. Select **Repositories** > **Security**.

1. Under **Users**, search for and select **Project Collection Build Service (*Your Organization Name*)**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You might not see *Your Organization Name* after the **Project Collection Build Service** user. It may be just a unique identifier. In this case, use the search function to find the user, and then select it.

1. Set the following permissions for the build service user:

   | Permission | Value |
   | --- | --- |
   | Contribute | Allow |
   | Contribute to pull requests | Allow |
   | Create branch | Allow |
   | Edit policies | Allow |

1. Under **Users**, search for and select ***Your Project Name* Build Service (*Your Organization Name*)**.

1. Set the same values as in step 4.

1. Select **Pipelines**, select the three dots (**&hellip;**) in the upper-right corner, and then select **Manage Security**.

1. Set the following permissions for the ***Your Project Name* Build Service (*Your Organization Name*)** user:

   | Permission | Value |
   | ---------- | ----- |
   | Edit build pipeline | Allow |
   | Edit build quality | Allow |
   | Manage build queue | Allow |
   | Override check-in validation by build | Allow |
   | Update build information | Allow |
   | View builds pipeline | Allow |
   | View builds | Allow |

1. Select **Project settings** > **Agent pools**, select **Security**, and then select **Add**.

1. Search for and select ***Your Project Name* Build Service (*Your Organization Name*)**.

1. Set the **Role** to **Reader**.

1. Select **Add**.

1. **(Optional)** By default, the pipeline permissions for each repository are restricted and you need to configure them individually. You can simplify that and allow access for any pipeline. Under **Project Settings** > **Repositories**, select each repository in turn. Select **Security** in the top menu. Find the **Pipeline permissions** block, select (**&hellip;**), and then select **Open access**.

## Development project setup

The following section guides you through the steps required to set up each of the development projects you support. In this context, a development project comprises the infrastructure and configuration that supports healthy application lifecycle management (ALM), including the configuration of the Dataverse environment that supports the ALM process itself.

### Create service connections for Azure DevOps to access Power Platform<a name="create-service-connections-for-azure-devops-to-access-power-platform"></a>

Each Dataverse environment&mdash;development, validation, test, and production&mdash;must have a Power Platform service connection in Azure DevOps. Perform the following steps for each of your environments.

> [!NOTE]
> ALM Accelerator app users see only environments in which they have either a user or administrator role on the service connection in Azure DevOps. If they work in personal development environments, makers must have a user or administrator role on the service connection for their personal development environment. Validation, test, and production environment service connections like the build service only need permissions granted to pipelines.

1. Sign in to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com), and then select your project.

1. Select **Project settings** > **Service connections**, and then select **Create service connection**.

1. Search for and select the **Power Platform** service connection type.

1. Select **Next**.

1. For **Server URL**, enter your environment URL; for example, `https://myorg.crm.dynamics.com/`.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > You must include the trailing forward slash (/) in the URL; that is, after *.com* in this example.

1. For **Service Connection Name**, enter the same URL you entered in step 4, including the training forward slash (/).

1. Enter the **Tenant ID**, **Application (client) ID**, and **Client Secret** you copied from Microsoft Entra when you [created the app registration](#create-the-app-registration).

1. Select **Grant access permissions to all pipelines**.

1. Select **Save**.

The service connections must provide user permissions to all users in all environments that users need to be able to access from the app (for example, maker environments).

1. In the **Service Connections** list, select the service connection to be shared with users.

1. Select **More** (**&hellip;**) in the upper-right corner, and then select **Security**.

1. In the **Group or User** list, select the user or group you want to provide user permissions to.

1. Select the **User**, select a **Role**, and then select **Add**.

Repeat the steps in this section for each of your development, validation, test, and production environments.

### Set permissions for the project build service to use the service connections

1. In Azure DevOps, select **Project settings** > **Service connections**.

1. Select (**&hellip;**) in the upper-right corner, select **Security**, and then select **Add**.

1. Search for and select ***Your Project Name* Build Service (*Your Organization Name*)**.

1. Set the **Role** to **Administrator**, and then select **Add**.

### Create an app user in your Dataverse environments

Create an application user in your environments to allow the pipelines to connect to Dataverse. Do this in each environment you plan to use the ALM Accelerator to deploy to.

1. Sign in to the [Power Platform admin center](https://aka.ms/ppac).

1. Select your development environment, and then select **Settings**.

1. Select **Users + permissions** > **Application users**.

1. Select **+ New app user**.

1. Select **+ Add an app**, select the app registration you created earlier, and then select **Add**.

1. Select the **Business Unit**.

1. Select the pencil icon to the right of **Security roles**, and then select security roles for the app user.

    We recommend you give the app user system administrator security role privileges, so the user can perform the required functions in each environment.

1. Select **Create**.

Repeat these steps in your validation, test, and production environments.

## Solution setup

When you create a solution in Dataverse, you need to create pipelines specifically for that solution. The following sample pipelines are included in the *Pipelines* directory in the *coe-alm-templates* repository:

- <https://github.com/microsoft/coe-alm-accelerator-templates/blob/main/Pipelines/build-deploy-validation-SampleSolution.yml>
- <https://github.com/microsoft/coe-alm-accelerator-templates/blob/main/Pipelines/build-deploy-test-SampleSolution.yml>
- <https://github.com/microsoft/coe-alm-accelerator-templates/blob/main/Pipelines/build-deploy-prod-SampleSolution.yml>

The sample pipelines provide flexibility for organizations to store their pipeline templates in a separate project or repo from the specific solution pipeline YAML. Follow the steps in this section to configure your solution pipeline. Repeat these steps for each solution for which you're using the ALM Accelerator for source control.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The YAML for your solution pipeline is always stored in the same repo you use for source control for your solution. However, the pipeline templates&mdash;that is, the folder *Pipeline\Templates*&mdash;can exist either in the same repo as your solution pipeline YAML or in a separate repo or project.

### Create the solution build and deployment pipelines

Solution pipelines are used to build and deploy your source-controlled solutions to environments in your tenant. The sample pipelines assume you're using only three environments: validation, test, and production. However, you can create as many solution pipelines as needed based on your organization's environment strategy.

The sample deployment pipelines are triggered by changes to a branch (that is, test and production) or as a part of a branch policy in Azure DevOps (that is, validation). [Learn more about setting branch policies for pull request validation](#set-branch-policies-for-pull-request-validation). You can also run pipelines manually, without a trigger.

Follow the steps in this section to create deployment pipelines from the sample pipeline YAML. The following table describes the pipeline configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The pipeline name must be exactly as shown in the following table, with the name of your solution in place of *MyNewSolution*.

| Pipeline YAML file name | Pipeline name | Branch policy enabled | Required |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- | -------- |
| build-deploy-validation-*MyNewSolution*.yml | deploy-validation-*MyNewSolution* | Yes | Yes |
| build-deploy-test-*MyNewSolution*.yml | deploy-test-*MyNewSolution* | No | Yes |
| build-deploy-prod-*MyNewSolution*.yml | deploy-prod-*MyNewSolution* | No | No (Go to the next section) |

> [!NOTE]
> The following steps create build and deploy pipelines for the validation, test, and production environments. However, you might want to build and deploy to validation and test and then deploy the artifacts from the test build to production. If that's the case, follow the steps in this section for only your validation and test environments. Then, skip to [Create the solution deployment pipeline](#create-the-solution-deployment-pipeline-optional) to configure your release pipeline.

#### Create the pipeline file

1. In Azure DevOps, go to the repo that contains the [pipelines folder you committed](#clone-the-yaml-pipelines-from-github-to-your-devops-instance), and select the **Pipelines** folder.

1. Open one of the three sample deployment pipelines and copy the YAML to use in your new pipeline.

1. Note the name of the repo for use in your pipeline.

1. Go to the repo that you want to use for source control for your solution.

1. Create a branch based on your default branch and name it for your solution; for example, *MyNewSolution*.

   This branch becomes the next version (v-next) branch for your solution. All development work must be branched from this branch to a developer's personal working branch, and then merged into the v-next branch to push to validation and testing. Later, when a release is ready, the v-next branch can be merged into the main or default branch.

1. Select **New** from the top menu, and then select **Folder**.

1. Give the new folder the same name as your solution.

1. Give the new pipeline YAML file a name, such as *build-deploy-validation-SampleSolution.yml*, *build-deploy-test-SampleSolution.yml*, or *build-deploy-prod-SampleSolution.yml*.

1. Select **Create**.

#### Update and save the file
<!-- EDITOR'S NOTE: I added this heading to break up this long sequence of steps. If there's a more accurate way to summarize these remaining steps, feel free to change the heading. Thanks! -->

1. Paste the YAML you copied in step 2 in the previous section into the new pipeline file.

1. Change the following values in the new pipeline YAML:

   - Change **Resources** > **Repositories** > **Name** to the name of the repo that contains your pipeline templates.

      In this example, the repo is named *coe-alm-accelerator-templates* and it exists in the same project as the *MyNewSolution* repo. If your template repository is in a different Azure DevOps project, use the format *ProjectName/RepoName*. You can also specify a branch for where your templates live using the `ref` parameter if necessary.

   - Change any value that refers to *SampleSolutionName* to the unique name of your solution; for example, *MyNewSolution*.

1. Select **Commit** to save your changes.

1. In Azure DevOps, go to **Pipelines**, and then select **Create a New Pipeline**.

1. Select **Azure Repos Git** for your code repository.

1. Select the **DevOps repo**, which contains the deployment pipeline YAML.

1. On the **Configure your pipeline** page, select **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file**, point to the YAML file in your repo that you created earlier, and then select **Continue**.

1. Select **Save**, select (**&hellip;**) next to **Run Pipeline**, and then select **Rename/Move**.

1. Change the pipeline name to *deploy-validation-MyNewSolution*, *deploy-test-MyNewSolution*, or *deploy-prod-MyNewSolution*, where *MyNewSolution* is the name of your solution.

1. Select **Save**.

1. If your new pipeline wasn't created in the repository's default branch: Select **Edit** on the pipeline. Select (**&hellip;**) in the upper-right corner, and then select **Triggers**. Select the **YAML** tab, and then select **Get Sources**. Change the **Default branch for manual and scheduled builds** to point to your solution branch. [Learn more about how to configure pipeline triggers](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/pipeline-triggers?tabs=YAML#branch-considerations-for-pipeline-completion-triggers).

1. Repeat the preceding steps to create a deployment pipeline for each of your environments, referencing the sample deployment pipeline YAML from the *coe-alm-accelerator-templates* repo (*deploy-validation-SampleSolution.yml*, *deploy-test-SampleSolution.yml*, and *deploy-prod-SampleSolution.yml*).

1. Select **Save and Queue**, and then select **Save**.

### Create the solution deployment pipeline (optional)

As mentioned earlier, the steps in the previous section create pipelines that build and deploy for validation, test, and production environments. However, you can create a separate solution deployment pipeline if you want to build and deploy only for validation and test and then deploy the artifacts from the test build to production.

Follow the steps in this section to create a solution deployment pipeline from the sample pipeline YAML. The following table describes the pipeline configuration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The pipeline name must be exactly as shown in the following table, with the name of your solution in place of *MyNewSolution*.

| Pipeline YAML file name | Pipeline name | Branch policy enabled |
| ----------------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| deploy-prod-*MyNewSolution*.yml | deploy-prod-*MyNewSolution* | No |

1. In Azure DevOps, go to the repo that contains the [pipelines folder you committed](#clone-the-yaml-pipelines-from-github-to-your-devops-instance) and select the **Pipelines** folder.

1. Open the sample deployment pipeline *deploy-prod-pipelineartifact-SampleSolution.yml*, and copy the YAML to use in your new pipeline.

1. Note the name of the repo for use in your pipeline.

1. Go to the repo that you want to use for source control for your solution.

1. Select **New** from the top menu, and then select **File**.

1. Give the new pipeline YAML file a name; for example, *deploy-prod-MyNewSolution.yml*, where *MyNewSolution* is the name of your solution.

1. Select **Create**.

1. Paste the YAML you copied in step 2 into the new pipeline file.

1. Change the following values in the new pipeline YAML:

   - Change **Trigger** > **Branches** > **Include** to the branches in which changes should trigger a deployment to production.

   - Change **Resources** > **Repositories** > **Name** to the name of the repo that contains your pipeline templates.

      In this example, the repo is named *coe-alm-accelerator-templates* and it exists in the same project as the *MyNewSolution* repo. If your template repository is in a different Azure DevOps project, use the format *ProjectName/RepoName*. You can also specify a branch for where your templates live using the `ref` parameter if necessary.

   - Update **Resources** > **Pipelines** > **Source** to specify the build pipeline that contains the artifacts this pipeline should deploy. In this case, you're going to deploy the artifacts from the test pipeline you created earlier, which built and deployed your solution to the test environment.

   - Change any value that refers to *SampleSolutionName* to the unique name of your solution; for example, *MyNewSolution*.

1. Repeat steps 11 through 20 in the previous section for *deploy-validation-ALMAcceleratorSampleSolution* and *deploy-test-ALMAcceleratorSampleSolution*, to create a pipeline from the new production pipeline YAML named *deploy-prod-ALMAcceleratorSampleSolution*.

### Set deployment pipeline variables

 For each deployment pipeline you configured earlier, you must set the values of the variables `EnvironmentName` and `ServiceConnection` based on the environment to which the pipeline deploys. You can also set the `EnableFlows` variable to turn off Power Automate flows as part of a deployment.

#### Create environment and service connection variables (required)

Every deployment pipeline requires the environment variable `EnvironmentName` and the service connection variable `ServiceConnection`.

- `EnvironmentName` specifies the [Azure DevOps environment](/azure/devops/pipelines/process/environments) that's being deployed to enable tracking deployment history and set permissions and approvals for deployment to specific environments. Set this value to **Validate**, **Test**, or **Production**, as appropriate.

- `ServiceConnection` specifies how the deployment pipeline connects to Power Platform. Allowed values are the names of the [service connections you created earlier](#create-service-connections-for-azure-devops-to-access-power-platform).

1. Select **Edit** on each of the deployment pipelines.

1. Select **Variables** on the deployment pipeline definition to open the variables editor.

1. To add a variable, select **(+)**. Enter the name of the variable and the appropriate value.

Repeat these steps to create the `EnvironmentName` and `ServiceConnection` variables.

#### Create the EnableFlows variable (optional)

You may set the value of a pipeline variable named `EnableFlows` to False to skip the steps that automatically enable Power Automate flows as part of a deployment. The default value of the `EnableFlows` variable is True.

### Set branch policies for pull request validation

Create a [branch policy](/azure/devops/repos/git/branch-policies) to execute the pipeline you created earlier when a pull request is created.

1. In Azure DevOps, go to **Repos**, and then select the **Branches** folder.

1. Find the branch for which you want to create the pull request policy. Select (**&hellip;**) to the right of the branch, and then select **Branch Policies**.

1. On the **Branch Policies** page, go to **Build Validation**.

1. Select **+** to add a new branch policy.

1. In the **Build pipeline** list, select the pipeline you created earlier.

1. Specify a **Path filter** if applicable to make sure that only changes to the specified path trigger the pipeline for the pull request.

1. Set the **Trigger** to **Automatic**.

1. Set the **Policy requirement** to **Required**.

1. Set the **Build expiration** to **Immediately**.

1. Set a **Display name** for your branch policy; for example, *PR Build Validation*.

1. Select **Save**.

To set job authorization scope at the organization level for all projects

1. In Azure DevOps,choose **Organization settings > Pipelines > Settings**.
1. Disable the **Limit job authorization scope to current project for release pipelines** setting.

### Create a deployment configuration (optional)

You need to create several configurations in a target environment after a solution is deployed. These configurations are specific to the environment and include connection references, environment variables, and permissions for Microsoft Entra groups and Dataverse teams, in addition to sharing canvas apps and updating the ownership of solution components such as Power Automate flows. Along with these configurations, a target environment often needs sample or configuration data that's associated with Dataverse tables in the solution to provide a full end-to-end ALM experience.

If your solution requires these other configurations or data, follow the [deployment configuration guide](setup-data-deployment-configuration.md) to configure your pipelines based on the environments to which you're deploying.

## Import the solution and configure the app

Import the ALM Accelerator canvas app into your Power Platform environment, and then configure the included custom connector for Azure DevOps.
