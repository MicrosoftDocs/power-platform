# Configure pipeline sync

We periodically release updates of the ALM Accelerator pipeline templates. Use the pipeline sync template that's included with the ALM Accelerator to keep your pipeline templates up-to-date automatically.

The pipeline sync template only updates the ALM Accelerator pipeline templates. [Upgrade the ALM Accelerator solution components](setup-upgrade-configuration.md) separately.

## Pipeline sync setup

To simplify the process, we created a pipeline template that automatically syncs your Azure DevOps repo with the pipeline template repo in the CoE Starter Kit GitHub repository. Here's how to get started with the pipeline sync pipeline.

1. To start, manually sync the [latest release](https://github.com/microsoft/coe-alm-accelerator-templates/releases) of the pipeline templates by [cloning the pipeline template repo to your Azure DevOps repo](setup-components-manually.md#clone-the-yaml-pipelines-from-github-to-your-devops-instance).

1. In Azure DevOps, go to **Pipelines**, and then select **Create a New Pipeline**.

1. Select **Azure Repos Git** for your code repository, and then point to the Azure DevOps repo you created and seeded with the pipeline templates in step 1.

1. On the **Configure your pipeline** page, select **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file**, point to */Pipelines/sync-pipeline-repo.yml*, and then select **Continue**.

1. On the next screen, select **Save**, select (**&hellip;**) next to **Run Pipeline**, and then select **Rename/Move**.

1. Change the pipeline name to *sync-pipeline-repo*, and then select **Save**.

1. Set the `TEMPLATE-REPO` pipeline variable to <*https://github.com/microsoft/coe-alm-accelerator-templates*>.

   You can use the sync pipeline to sync any GitHub repo to Azure DevOps. Set the `TEMPLATE-REPO` variable to the source GitHub repo to specify the sync source.

1. Run the new pipeline.

1. Enter the name of the **SourceBranch** and **BranchToCreate** in Azure DevOps, and the **TargetBranch**, such as *main*.

1. Select **Run**.

1. After the pipeline runs, a pull request is created for the **BranchToCreate** into the **TargetBranch**. To commit the changes, approve and complete the pull request.

    If the pull request has merge conflicts, you need to resolve them to complete the upgrade. Use the free Azure DevOps extension **Pull Request Merge Conflict**, available in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-devlabs.conflicts-tab).
