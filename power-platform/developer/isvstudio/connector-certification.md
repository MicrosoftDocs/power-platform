# Connector certification

If you own a service or API, or you've built a custom connector that you want to connect to Power Apps, Power Automate, Azure Logic Apps, or Power Query, you need to submit your connector to Microsoft for certification.

Connector certification is now included in ISV Studio, so you can use it to manage and track your connector certification submission. More information: [Submit your connector for Microsoft certification](/connectors/custom-connectors/submit-certification)

> [!NOTE]
> Before you start submitting your connector for certification, see [Instructions on submitting your connector](/connectors/custom-connectors/certification-submission) for submission requirements.

**To certify your custom connector through ISV Studio**

1. In ISV Studio, select **Connector certification** in the leftmost pane.

2. Select the type of connector to certify, and then select **Submit**.
