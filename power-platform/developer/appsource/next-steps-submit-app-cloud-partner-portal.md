# Next steps: Submit your app on Partner Center

Your app is ready for submission after completing steps 1-4.

Sign in to [Partner Center](https://partner.microsoft.com/dashboard/account/v3/enrollment/introduction/azureisv) to [create an offer](/azure/marketplace/dynamics-365-customer-engage-offer-setup) and submit your app.

All apps that are submitted to be listed on AppSource go through a certification process. For information about the checks done in the certification process, see [Appendix: App certification checklist](appendix-app-certification-checklist.md)
