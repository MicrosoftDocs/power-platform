# Step 4: Store your AppSource Package on Azure Storage and generate a URL with SAS key

Microsoft Azure Storage is a Microsoft-managed cloud service that provides storage that is highly available, secure, durable, scalable, and redundant. More information: [Introduction to Microsoft Azure Storage](/azure/storage/common/storage-introduction).

To maintain security of your files, all app developers must store their AppSource package file in a Microsoft Azure Blob storage account, and use a Shared Access Signature (SAS) key to share the package file. Your package file is retrieved from your Azure Storage location for certification, and then for AppSource trials.

## Before you upload your package

Download and install the Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer from [https://storageexplorer.com](https://storageexplorer.com).

Azure Storage Explorer lets you easily manage the contents of your storage account.

## Upload your package and generate a URL with SAS key

To upload your package to Azure Blob storage:

1. Create a free trial or pay as you go Azure account at [https://azure.microsoft.com](https://azure.microsoft.com).
1. Sign in to Azure Management portal at [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Create a new Storage account by clicking  > **Storage** > **Storage account - blob, file, table, queue**.

1. In Azure Storage Explorer, select the newly created container, and then select **Upload** > **Upload Files** to upload the app source package that you created in [Step 4: Create an AppSource package for your app](create-package-app.md). 

   :::image type="content" source="media/appsource-storageaccount-pic5.png" alt-text="Upload the app source package.":::
