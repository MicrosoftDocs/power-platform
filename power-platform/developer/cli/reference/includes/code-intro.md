> Starting with [Power Apps SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/power-apps?activeTab=readme) v1.0.4 and higher, the SDK includes an npm-based CLI for code apps. This new CLI reduces prerequisites for building code apps and will replace these commands, which will be deprecated in a future release. To learn more about the new commands and get started, see [Quickstart with new npm CLI](/power-apps/developer/code-apps/how-to/npm-quickstart).
