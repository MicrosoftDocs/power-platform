# Publish your app on Marketplace

Publish your app on [Microsoft Marketplace](https://marketplace.microsoft.com) so that app subscribers can find it, try it, and buy it. The apps you build and publish with Power Apps are discovered and used in Dynamics 365 on the web. More information: [Discover apps via Marketplace](/power-apps/user/app-source).
