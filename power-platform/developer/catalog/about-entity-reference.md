# Catalog in Power Platform table/entity reference

This reference is based on the [Dataverse table/entity reference](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/about-entity-reference) except that it only includes tables added by the Power Platform Catalog manager managed solution to support the catalog in Power Platform.

> [!NOTE]
> The Power Platform Catalog manager managed solution makes many more changes to columns and relationships for existing Dataverse tables. These changes aren't included here because they don't impact core scenarios to use these tables.
>
> The [Catalog Submission Files (mspcat_CatalogSubmissionFiles)](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/mspcat_catalogsubmissionfiles) and [Package Submission Store (mspcat_PackageStore)](/power-apps/developer/data-platform/reference/entities/mspcat_packagestore) tables are found in every Dataverse environment. The Power Platform Catalog manager application doesn't add these tables.
