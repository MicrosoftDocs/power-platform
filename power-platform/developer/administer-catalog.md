# Administer the catalog (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Before you can administer the catalog, you must install and configure it. More information: [Get started](catalog.md#get-started)

Administering the catalog includes the following tasks:

- [Setup users](#setup-users)
- [Approve and reject submission requests](#approve-and-reject-submission-requests)
- [Review install history](#review-install-history)
- [Review catalog items](#review-catalog-items)
- [Review errors in submission requests](#review-errors-in-submission-requests)
- [Review errors in install requests](#review-errors-in-install-requests)

## Setup users

The **Catalog Manager** application includes the following security roles you can associate to users, Microsoft Azure Active Directory groups, and modern teams:

|Role |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Catalog Submitter**|Users with this role can submit items to the catalog.|
|**Catalog Read-Only Member**|Users with this role can discover and install items from the catalog  |
|**Catalog Approver**  |Users with this role can approve submissions to the catalog. Catalog approvers can be users from your central IT department or Line of Business that your organization wants to empower to participate in the approvals process.|
|**Catalog Administrator**|Users with this role can administer the catalog.|

More information: [Assign a security role to a user](../admin/assign-security-roles.md) and [Manage the security roles of a team](../admin/manage-teams.md#manage-the-security-roles-of-a-team).

## Approve and reject submission requests

Environment admins and users with the Catalog Approver role can review new submissions and approve or decline requests. If global auto approval or publisher level auto approval is turned on, then there's no requirement for manual review and approval. More information: [Enable Auto Approval](catalog.md#enable-auto-approval)

In the **Approvals** section of the navigation pane, select **Requests**.
This list has 16 views. The most important ones are:

|View |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|**Active Approval Requests** (Default)|Use this view to review submission requests pending approval|
|**All Approval Request**|Use this view to review all requests across all statuses|
|**Failed Pre-Validation**|Use this view to identify requests where a submitter has sent a request but it isn't available in the **Active Approval Requests** view. This view can help with troubleshooting such scenarios.|
|**Approved Approval Request**|Use this view to review previously approved requests|

Using the **Active Approval Requests** view, open a request and select **Resolve Request** in the menu.

- Select **Reject Request** to decline the request. The request is archived and publisher, item and asset aren't created.
- Select **Complete Request** to approve. Upon approval, Publisher, Item and Assets be created. The request is archived to **Inactive** status.

## Review install history

In the **Deployment History** section of the navigation pane, select **Install History** to view a list of installations that were requested from the catalog.

- **Inactive Applications** An inactive item can be reactivated, but a deleted item can't be reinstated. Disabled items don't feature in discovery and list command response.
- **Pending Approval**
- **Published** (Default) This view shows the most recent version of the item.

These views show the following columns:

|Column|Description|

|**Name (Publishers)** |Name of the publisher|

|**Allow Auto-Approval**|By enabling auto approval at the Publisher level, future submissions from this publisher are auto approved.
