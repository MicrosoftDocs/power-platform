# View, submit, and install catalog items (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Before you can work with catalog items, you must install and configure it. More information: [Get started](catalog.md#get-started)

Application makers and developers can submit items to the catalog so that they can help their colleagues solve business problems.

## Get started

1. [Install PAC CLI](#install-pac-cli)
1. [Get access to catalog as Submitter or Reader](#get-access-to-catalog-as-submitter-or-reader)

### Install PAC CLI

Follow the steps to install Power Platform CLI found here: [Install Microsoft Power Platform CLI](cli/introduction.md#install-microsoft-power-platform-cli)

Use the [pac catalog](cli/reference/catalog.md) commands to interact with the catalog.

### Get access to catalog as Submitter or Reader

Contact your administrator to grant access to the catalog. You need the **Catalog Submitter** security role to be associated with your user account or a team that you belong to. More information: [Setup Users](administer-catalog.md#setup-users)

## Use the catalog

After you have installed the PAC CLI, you must create an authentication profile using the [pac auth create](cli/reference/auth.md#pac-auth-create) command. Using the authentication profile for the environment where the catalog is installed, you can perform the following tasks using PAC CLI:

1. [View available catalogs in your tenant](#view-available-catalogs-in-your-tenant)
1. [View items in the catalog](#view-items-in-the-catalog)
1. [Install items from the catalog](#install-items-from-the-catalog)
1. [Submit items to the catalog](#submit-items-to-the-catalog)
1. [Check status of catalog submissions](#check-status-of-catalog-submissions)

## View available catalogs in your tenant

Use the [pac admin list](cli/reference/admin.md#pac-admin-list) command to view the catalogs available in your tenant.

> [!NOTE]
> This command requires an administrator authentication profile.

When using this command, you must use the following `--application` parameter with the value `83a35943-cb41-4266-b7d2-81d60f383695`.

```powershell
pac admin list --application 83a35943-cb41-4266-b7d2-81d60f383695
```

`83a35943-cb41-4266-b7d2-81d60f383695` is the application ID associated with the catalog. The requirement to include this value will be removed in a future update.

## View items in the catalog

Use the [pac catalog list](cli/reference/catalog.md#pac-catalog-list) command to view items in the catalog.

```powershell
pac catalog list 
Connected to... TestCatalog
Connected as user@domain
Listing all published catalog items from the current Dataverse Organization...
Catalog Item Name                   Publisher Name            Catalog Item Id                      Revision Id                          Version Status
Contoso Conference Custom Connector Catalog Conferences Team  ContosoConferencesCustomConnector    4e882dd6-74f3-ed11-8849-000d3a0a286b 1.0.0.1 Published
Contoso Themed Components           ContosoPublisher          ContosoThemedComponents              efbc469d-f1b2-ed11-83fd-000d3a0a2d9d 1.0.0.1 Published
```

## Install items from the catalog

Use the [pac catalog install](cli/reference/catalog.md#pac-catalog-install) command to install items from the catalog.

```powershell
pac catalog install -tu https://<your org>.crm.dynamics.com/ -cid ContosoConferencesCustomConnector
Connected to... TestCatalog
Connected as user@domain
ContosoConferencesCustomConnector
Tracking id for this installation is 202012ec-80f3-ed11-8849-000d3a0a2d9d
```

## Submit items to the catalog

To submit an item to the catalog, you need:

- A solution or package deployer package containing the item you want to submit
- A submission metadata JSON document

Use the [pac catalog create-submission](cli/reference/catalog.md#pac-catalog-create-submission) command to get an example submission metadata JSON document. You must edit this document and more submission attributes can be added. More information: [Submission Attributes](#submission-attributes)

After your submission metadata JSON document is ready, use the [pac catalog submit](cli/reference/catalog.md#pac-catalog-submit) command to submit it.

```powershell
pac catalog submit -p "BuildDemoSubmission.json" -sz "ContosoConference_1_0_0_1_managed.zip"
Creating package for catalog submit request...
Connected to... TestCatalog
Connected as user@domain
Tracking id for this submission is 0e6b119d-80f3-ed11-8849-000d3a0a2d9d
```

## Check status of catalog submissions

Use the [pac catalog status](cli/reference/catalog.md#pac-catalog-status) command to check the status of catalog submissions.

```powershell
pac catalog status --tracking-id 0e6b119d-80f3-ed11-8849-000d3a0a2d9d --type submit
Connected to... TestCatalog
Connected as user@domain
Status of the Submit request: Submitted
```

## Submission Attributes

Before you can submit items to a catalog, you must prepare a JSON document that describes the items you want to submit. More information: [Submit items to the catalog](#submit-items-to-the-catalog)

To help you, the [pac catalog create-submission](cli/reference/catalog.md#pac-catalog-create-submission) command generates a sample `submission.json` file.

> [!NOTE]
> More attributes are supported in the submission file and those are covered in the subsequent section.

You need to edit this file to submit an item. Here's an example submission created from the JSON above.

```json
{
  "modelVersion": "1.0.0.0",
  "operation": "CreateOrUpdate",
  "sourcePortal": 526430005,
  "businessJustification": "Power Platform custom connector for Conference API",
  "publisherDetails": {
    "publisherId": "ContosoConferencesTeam",
    "publisherDisplayName": "Catalog Conferences Team"
  },
  "catalogItemDefinition": {
    "id": "ContosoConferencesCustomConnector",
    "displayName": "Contoso Conference Custom Connector",
    "description": "Demo Custom connector to query Conference Speakers & Sessions",
    "offer": {
      "type": "Component_Collection",
      "deploymentType": "Normal",
      "engineeringName": {
        "firstName": "Jennifer",
        "lastName": "Wilkins",
        "email": "jwilkins@contoso.com",
        "phoneNumber": "555-111-1234"
      },
      "supportName": {
        "firstName": "Aidan",
        "lastName": "Hunt",
        "email": "ahunt@mouse.com",
        "phoneNumber": "555-111-1234"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Required Data

The following items are required for all submissions:

- [Publisher](#publisher)
- [Catalog Item](#catalog-item)
- [Engineering contact](#engineering-contact)
- [Support contact](#support-contact)

#### Publisher

Creates a publisher record that can be associated to one or more Microsoft Entra ID groups containing authorized users who can make updates to the Catalog item going forward.

Don't confuse this term with *Solution Publisher*. Catalog item publisher is entirely a different concept.

You need to provide the ID publisher `DisplayName` at a minimum. ID can be any string value. System checks if that publisher exists, else creates it and assigns an ID.

Example: HR IT team of developers can create a publisher and ID the developers using an Microsoft Entra ID group.

Here's an example of a publisher record:

```json
"publisherDetails": {
   "publisherId": "MyPublisherId",
   "publisherDisplayName": "Contoso Publishing",
   "publisherUpnList": [
      {
         "action": "Add",
         "upn": "john.doe@contoso.com"
      }
   ],
   "publisherAADGroupOIDS": [
      {
         "action": "Add",
         "groupName": "PowerCatalogSubmitters",
         "groupOID": "2ded6de9-ab44-4478-9bd4-e609947daa2e",
         "groupType": "Security"
      }
   ]
}
  ```
