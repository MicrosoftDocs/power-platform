Important changes (deprecations) coming in Power Apps, Power Automate, and customer engagement apps
============================================================

The announcements and deprecations described in this topic apply to Power Apps, Power Automate, and customer engagement apps (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Marketing, Dynamics 365 Field Service, and Dynamics 365 Project Service Automation).

Administrators and IT professionals should use this information to prepare for future releases. This article was first published on June 27, 2017.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> "Deprecated" means we intend to remove the feature or capability from a future major release. The feature or capability will continue to work and is fully supported until it is officially removed. This deprecation
notification can span a few years. After removal, the feature or capability will no longer work. We are notifying you now so you have sufficient time to plan and update your code before the feature or capability is removed.

## Automatic record creation rules and SLA items in web client are deprecated

Effective October 01, 2020, the automatic record creation and update rules and service-level agreements (SLAs) have been deprecated in the web client. For more information, see [Deprecations in Customer Service](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2145032).

## TimeZoneRule entity and some attributes of TimeZoneDefinition entity are deprecated

Effective September 24, 2020, the **TimeZoneRule** entity and the **Bias** and **RetiredOrder** attributes of the **TimeZoneDefinition** entity are deprecated and will be removed in a future release. For all client-side time zone calculations, use the [LocalTimeFromUtcTime](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/localtimefromutctime) and [UtcTimeFromLocalTime](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-engagement/web-api/utctimefromlocaltime) functions in Web API or the [TimeZoneInfo](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.timezoneinfo) class in the .NET framework. More information: [Blog: Deprecation of time zone entities in Common Data Service](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/deprecation-of-time-zone-entities-in-common-data-service/) 


## Online management API PowerShell module is deprecated

Effective August 26, 2020, the online management API PowerShell module is deprecated. The [online management API PowerShell module](/powershell/powerapps/get-started-onlinemanagementapi?view=pa-ps-latest) will be updated in October, 2020 to point to newer underlying APIs and won’t receive further updates. We recommend that you use the Power Apps administration module. More information: [Get started using the Power Apps admin module](/powershell/powerapps/get-started-powerapps-admin?view=pa-ps-latest)

## Company News Timeline solution is deprecated

Effective July 10, 2020, the [Company News Timeline](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/company-news-timeline/get-company-news-timeline-dynamics-365-phones-tablets) solution, which delivers relevant news from Bing News about customers and categorizes it in inline when you're looking at customer accounts will be deprecated. Until September 10, 2020, Microsoft will continue to provide support for the feature, but won't release any additional functionality beyond what is already present. Starting September 10, 2020, you will need to uninstall the solution which will remove the news widget from the Account record pages. 

1. To remove the solution, go to **Advanced settings** and select **Solutions**. 
2. Select **CompanyNewsTimeline** and then select **Delete**. 

As an alternative you can install news Power Apps component framework control. For more information, see [Set up and use the news control](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/stay-current-with-news-control).

## Dynamic 365 Sales bot is deprecated
----------------------------------------
Effective June 2, 2020, the Dynamics 365 Sales bot, a feature that enables users to retrieve sales information through a bot within Dynamics 365 Sales app for Teams will be deprecated. Until July 31, 2020, Microsoft will continue to provide support for the feature, but won't release any additional functionality beyond what is already present.  After July 31, 2020, you will no longer be able to receive responses to conversations. The bot won’t be available for new customers; existing customers may still be able to access the bot from the Chat, however the bot will not respond to questions.

It is our goal to deliver a powerful bot experience that allows users to retrieve and manage information. Based on usage data and feedback from our customers, we will be working on a powerful, extensible set of capabilities and features that will allow you to intuitively access and interact with sales information—among other entities—through a bot interface. We will keep you updated on timing for when this will be available.

## Dynamics 365 Connector is deprecated

Effective May 5, 2020 the [Dynamics 365 connector](/connectors/dynamicscrmonline/) used for Flows, Logic Apps and Canvas Apps is officially deprecated. We recommend that you do not create new connections using this connector.

Rather than use the Dynamics 365 connector, the [Common Data Service (Current Environment) connector](/connectors/commondataserviceforapps/) should be your first choice *if you can use it*. You may not be able to use the Common Data Service (Current Environment) connector in every situation today because of the following limitations:

- It is not available in Logic Apps.
- It does not enable cross-tenant or cross environment connections. 
- It cannot be used for canvas apps that use the [Power Apps for Windows client](https://www.microsoft.com/p/power-apps/9nblggh5z8f3).

If you cannot use the Common Data Service (Current Environment) connector, you should use the [Common Data Service connector](/connectors/commondataservice/). This connector has all the capabilities of the Dynamics 365 connector, and includes several improvements that increase reliability.

The Common Data Service (Current Environment) connector represents the future for connections using Common Data Service. This includes Dynamics 365 apps using Common Data Service. Work is underway to make this connector the only connector you will need. But at the current time, the previously mentioned limitations mean that you can't use it in all places where the Dynamics 365 connector or Common Data Service Connector can be used today.

At this time, there is no requirement to convert canvas apps, flows, or logic apps to stop using the Dynamics 365 connector because of the known blocking limitations. But you should stop creating new connections with the Dynamics 365 connector and convert them if you can.

|Type|Guidance|
|---------|---------|
|Flows|If you can convert existing Flows to use the Common Data Service (Current Environment) connector we recommend you do so.|
|Logic Apps|We recommend you stop creating new connections using the Dynamics 365 connector and use the Common Data Service Connector instead.|
|Canvas Apps|Canvas apps created after November 2019 should not have used the connector infrastructure by default. These apps should automatically connect to the Common Data Service instance within the same environment. <br /><br />If you have an canvas app that used the  Dynamics 365 connector, find information about how to convert them here: [Converting canvas apps with the Dynamics 365 connector](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/use-native-cds-connector#converting-canvas-apps-with-the-dynamics-365-connector).|

### Forward looking guidance

When the Common Data Service (Current Environment) connector represents a viable replacement for all situations where the Dynamics 365 and Common Data Service connectors are used today, we intend to remove both the current Dynamics 365 and Common Data Service connectors so that a single connector based on the Common Data Service (Current Environment) connector will remain. At that time it will be required to convert any Flows, Logic Apps and Canvas Apps still using the Dynamics 365 and Common Data Service connectors.

We will announce timelines as they are determined.


## AI Builder text classification models are deprecated
-------------------------------------------------------

Effective April 24, 2020, any text classification models created using AI Builder before this date will be deprecated. Until May 15, 2020, these models will continue to function, and Microsoft will continue to provide support, however some functionality may be disabled. After May 15, 2020, these models will no longer work.

Beginning April 24, 2020, customers will need to recreate their existing text classification models with the new model versions. Any models created after this date will automatically use the new model versions and require no further action.

After April 24, 2020, customers are encouraged to transition to the new model versions as soon as possible.

## Dynamic 365 for Outlook is deprecated
----------------------------------------

Effective March 2020, the legacy Dynamics 365 for Outlook (also referred to as Outlook COM add-in) is deprecated. Customers must transition to the modern [Dynamics 365 App for Outlook](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/outlook-app/overview) before October 1, 2020. Microsoft will continue to provide support, security and other critical updates to the Outlook COM Add-in until October 1, 2020.

For further information and steps to make a smooth transition, download [Dynamics 365 for Outlook (COM add-in) Playbook](https://aka.ms/OutlookCOMPlaybook)

## Dynamics 365 Home is deprecated 
------------------------------------------------------

Effective March 2020, the home page for Dynamics 365 applications (https://home.dynamics.com) is deprecated and won't be available after October 31, 2020. The Microsoft 365 apps page (https://www.office.com/apps) will replace it and provide users with a single page for productivity and business applications.  

Dynamics 365 Home users will see notification about the new location and recommendation to change browser bookmarks starting October 1, 2020. After October 31, 2020, users navigating to <https://home.dynamics.com> will automatically be redirected to <https://www.office.com/apps> with a business application filter applied.

More information: <https://aka.ms/business-apps-discovery-docs>

## Form processing and object detection preview models in AI Builder are deprecated 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effective March 5, 2020, any form processing and object detection models created using AI Builder before this date will be deprecated. Until June 8, 2020, these models will continue to function, and Microsoft will continue to provide support, however some functionality may be disabled. After June 8, 2020, these models will no longer work. 

Beginning March 5, 2020, customers will need to recreate their existing form processing and object detection models with the new model versions. Any models created after this date will automatically use the new model versions and require no further action.

After March 5, 2020, customers are encouraged to transition to the new model versions as soon as possible.

More information:

- [Transition to use a new object detection model version](/ai-builder/object-detection-transition)

Old Common Data Service environment URL redirector service is deprecated
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
When you access your Common Data Service environment for the first time or every time after you have signed out from a prior session, you are directed to Azure AD for signing in. In the sign-in page URL, it contains a set of internal values/codes that include a link to the URL redirector service. Upon successful login, the URL redirector service directs you to your Common Data Service environment.

The old URL redirector service, cloudredirector.crm.dynamics.com, was replaced in September 2019 with the new one, bn1--namcrlivesg614.crm.dynamics.com (just an example; the URL will differ based on your environment region). The old URL redirector service is deprecated, and will be removed on **March 31, 2020**. 

This change will impact you if you have created a bookmark of the sign-in page before September 2019 that contained the link to the old URL redirector service. The users impacted by this change will see a notification staring February 17, 2020 with instructions to resolve the issue. For detailed information about this issue and how to resolve it, see <https://support.microsoft.com/help/4541747>. 

Deprecation of Office365 authentication type and OrganizationServiceProxy class for connecting to Common Data Service
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effective Feb 4, 2020, the **WS-Trust** authentication type that is used by
custom clients to connect to Common Data Service is deprecated. This change
affects applications that utilize
[Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Client.OrganizationServiceProxy](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.client.organizationserviceproxy)
and
[Microsoft.Xrm.Tooling.Connector.CrmServiceClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.tooling.connector.crmserviceclient)
classes for the authentication type of "Office365".

We are making this change to remove a security protocol (WS-Trust) that is
inherently insecure by current encryption standards. While Microsoft has worked
extremely hard to protect users who choose to use this authentication type for
the convenience of login process, it has become an increasing source of concern
for Microsoft security and identity protection systems. The WS-Trust security
protocol, when used in conjunction with a user account and password, implements
an authentication flow that presents both the user Id and password to the
authenticating resource in 'clear text' form, relying solely on the transport
encryption to provide security for the initial leg of the authentication, until
such point as the token service returns an authentication token to use.
Additionally, the WS-Trust protocol does not support modern forms of
Multi-Factor Authentication and conditional access controls to customer data.

With this change, the intent is to guide developers away from this
authentication flow and help application developers to utilize the capabilities
of Azure Active Directory to secure and protect access to their applications and
customers in Common Data Service.

To allow for transition of customers and partner applications: 

- Effective October 2020, the authentication protocol will be retired for all new tenants.
- Effective October 2020, the authentication protocol will not be available in all new [regions](admin/regions-overview.md#what-regions-are-available).
- Effective April 2021, the authentication protocol will be retired for all new environments within a tenant.
- Effective April 2022, the authentication protocol will be retired for all new and existing environments within a tenant.

More information: [Use of Office365 authentication with the WS-Trust security protocol](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/authenticate-office365-deprecation)

Regional Discovery Service is deprecated
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Effective March 2, 2020, the *regional* [Discovery Service](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/org-service/discovery-service) will be deprecated. Until March 1, 2021, Microsoft will continue to provide support, security, and other critical updates for the *regional* Discovery Service, but won't release any additional functionality beyond what has already been announced. After March 1, 2021, the *regional* Discovery Service won't be available.

Customers must transition to using the [global OData V4 Discovery Service](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/webapi/discover-url-organization-web-api#global-discovery-service) before March 1, 2021. More information: [Modify your code to use global Discovery Service](/powerapps/developer/common-data-service/webapi/discovery-orgsdk-to-webapi).

Rules feature in canvas apps is deprecated
----------------------------------

Effective October 14, 2019, the [rules](/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/working-with-rules) feature in canvas apps in Power Apps is deprecated. Few people have made use of rules in their canvas apps. From feedback collected through research and discussions with makers of Power Apps, the rules feature was confusing, and expressions were easier to learn, use, and debug. For more information about the rules feature deprecation, see [Blog: Canvas Rules feature deprecation](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/blog/canvas-rules-feature-deprecation/).


Legacy web client is deprecated
-------------------------------
As of September 2019, the legacy web client is deprecated. Customers must transition to Unified Interface before December 1, 2020. Microsoft will continue to provide support, security and other critical updates to the legacy web client until December 1, 2020 but won't release any additional functionality beyond what has already been announced.
  
On December 1, 2020, the legacy web client will no longer be available. Organizations should make the transition to the Unified Interface as soon as possible to take advantage of Microsoft’s ongoing investments in reliability, performance, and functionality. 

 
In the coming months, for those that have not already made the transition, we will be sending reminders and scheduling updates to transition customers to Unified Interface prior to December 1, 2020.

    default](https://docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/transition-web-app)

Task flows are deprecated
-------------------------
[Task flows](/flow/create-mobile-task-flow) are used to create a step-by-step data entry form for common tasks, such as after-meeting follow-ups. 

Task flows are deprecated and will be removed by October 1, 2020. They will be
replaced by the immersive experience for business process flows that is planned
for release. More information: [Business process flow immersive
experiences](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-platform-release-plan/2019wave2/microsoft-flow/business-process-immersive-experiences)

Process Dialogs are deprecated
------------------------------

You can use a process dialog to create an interactive step-by-step data entry
form that requires user input to start and run to completion. When you start the
dialog process, a wizard-like interface is presented; users make selections or
enter data as they progress through each page of the wizard.

Process dialogs are deprecated and will be removed by December 1, 2020. Suggested replacement options include Business Process Flows or Canvas Apps. More information: [Replace dialogs with business process flows or canvas apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/flow/replace-dialogs)

Legacy process-related attributes in entities are deprecated
------------------------------------------------------------

The legacy process-related attributes (such as **StageId**, and **TraversedPath**) on entities enabled for business process flows are now deprecated. The **SetProcess** action for business process flows is also deprecated. Manipulating these legacy process-related attributes for target entity records does not guarantee consistency of the business process flow state, and is not a supported scenario. The recommended way is to use the attributes of the business process flow entity. More information: [Create, retrieve, update, and delete business process flow entity records](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/developer/model-business-process-flows#create-retrieve-update-and-delete-business-process-flow-entity-records-process-instances)

Some client APIs are deprecated
-------------------------------

The following client APIs are deprecated to reorganize the Xrm client API object model to better align with the need of using the same
client scripts without having to change them based on the context or the client
(web client or the new Unified Interface) where they run. You should plan to use
the new client APIs mentioned in the **Replacement Client API** column instead
of the deprecated ones. The deprecated client APIs will continue to be available
and supported until they are officially removed from a future major release. *A public announcement here in the documentation, on the Dynamics 365 blog, and in many other places will be made at least six months before removal.*

Based on the feedback, we understand that the usage of **Xrm.Page** is high, and it won't be removed as soon as some other client API methods listed in this section. We encourage you to use the new way of getting form content where possible.

If the HTML web resource is opened in a new window then you should use `opener.Xrm` instead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                 **Earlier**: An HTML web resource may interact with the **Xrm.Page** or **Xrm.Utility** objects within the form by using **parent.Xrm.Page** or **parent.Xrm.Utility**. <br/><br>**Now**: parent.Xrm.\* will work if the HTML web resource is loaded in a form container. It won't work for HTML web resources that are stand alone, or referenced from the site map or any other places.<br/><br/>**NOTE**: `parent.Xrm` will be removed after the removal of the `ClientGlobalContext.js.aspx` page; dates yet to be announced.                  |

EntityMetadata.IsInteractionCentricEnabled property is deprecated
-----------------------------------------------------------------

All entities supported in the Unified Interface are now enabled for the interactive experience in the new Customer Service Hub app. This implies that
the **EntityMetadata**.[IsInteractionCentricEnabled](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.metadata.entitymetadata.isinteractioncentricenabled)
property, which indicates whether an entity can be enabled for interactive experience, is no longer relevant. The corresponding setting for this property
in the Customization tool, **Enable for interactive experience**, is removed, and the
**EntityMetadata**.[IsInteractionCentricEnabled](/dotnet/api/microsoft.xrm.sdk.metadata.entitymetadata.isinteractioncentricenabled)
property will be removed from the future version.


Voice of the Customer is deprecated 
-----------------------------------
The Voice of the Customer solution is used to create and send surveys for collecting feedback.  

As of July 1, 2019, the Voice of the Customer solution is deprecated. Users can create and distribute new surveys and collect responses from live surveys till July 1, 2020.  

A new solution, Dynamics 365 Customer Voice, is generally available to capture customer feedback using surveys. Customers can learn more about Customer Voice [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/customer-voice/help-hub).

Dynamics 365 for Blackberry is deprecated
------------------------------------------
As of December 3, 2018, Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Blackberry App is deprecated and will be removed from the iOS App Store on October 31, 2019. The mobile app is currently available on the iOS App Store and is designed for Dynamics 365 customers that utilize Blackberry Mobile Application Management. See more details about the Dynamics 365 for Blackberry app here: [Secure your mobile data with Microsoft Dynamics 365 for Good](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/mobile-app/v8/go-mobile/admin-troubleshoot/secure-mobile-data-dynamics-365-good). After October 31, 2019, Microsoft Intune will be the only supported mobile application management solution for the [Dynamics 365 for phones application](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/mobile-app/install-dynamics-365-for-phones-and-tablets). 

Microsoft will continue to provide security and other critical updates to the Dynamics 365 for Blackberry App until October 31, 2019, but will not release any additional features or functionalities within the app. After October 31, 2019, the Dynamics 365 for Blackberry App will be removed from the App Store, and support will end.

**What should you do?**

If you are currently using the Dynamics 365 for Blackberry App together with Mobile Application Management for Blackberry, plan to migrate to Dynamics 365 for phones by October 31, 2019. We encourage you to migrate as soon as possible to take advantage of Microsoft's ongoing investments in the reliability, performance, and functionality of the Dynamics 365 mobile app.
