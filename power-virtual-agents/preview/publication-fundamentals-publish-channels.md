# Publish your bot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [Preview disclaimer](includes/public-preview-disclaimer.md)]

You need to publish your bot before your customers can engage with it. You can publish your bot on multiple platforms, or channels.

After you've published your bot to at least one channel, you can connect it to more channels. Remember to publish your bot again after you make any changes to it. Publishing your bot updates it across all the channels it's connected to. If you don't, your customers won't be engaging with the latest content.

## Publish the latest bot content

1. With your bot open for editing, in the navigation menu, select **Publish**.

1. Select **Publish**, and then confirm.

Publishing can take up to a few minutes.

## Test your bot

Test your bot after it's published. Select the **demo website** link to open a prebuilt website in a new browser tab, where you and your teammates can interact with the bot. The demo website is also useful to gather feedback from stakeholders before you roll your bot out to customers. Learn how to [configure the demo website and add the bot to your live website](publication-connect-bot-to-web-channels.md).

> [!TIP]
> **What's the difference between the test chat and the demo website?**  
> Use the test chat (the **Test bot** pane) while you're building your bot to make sure conversation flows as you expect and to spot errors.
>
> Share the demo website URL with members of your team or other stakeholders to try out the bot. The demo website isn't intended for production use. You shouldn't share the URL with customers.
