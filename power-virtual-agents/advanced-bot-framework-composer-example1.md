# Example 1 - Show an Adaptive Card in Power Virtual Agents 

You can enhance your bot by developing custom dialogs with [Bot Framework Composer](/composer/) and then adding them to your Power Virtual Agents bot. 

In this example, you'll learn how to show an Adaptive Card in Power Virtual Agents by using Composer.

Before you begin, ensure you read [Extend your bot with Bot Framework Composer](advanced-bot-framework-composer.md) to understand how Composer integrates with Power Virtual Agents.



>[!IMPORTANT]
>Bot Framework Composer integration is not available to users who only have the [Teams Power Virtual Agents license](requirements-licensing-subscriptions.md). You must have a [trial](sign-up-individual.md) or full Power Virtual Agents license.


## Prerequisites

- [Extend your bot with Bot Framework Composer](advanced-bot-framework-composer.md)
- [Introduction to Bot Framework Composer](/composer/introduction)
- [!INCLUDE [Medical and emergency usage](includes/pva-usage-limitations.md)]



## Show an Adaptive Card

Go to **Topics** in Power Virtual Agents and create a new topic called **Meal delivery options**. Add the following trigger phrases for this new topic:
- what meals can I order
- what meal options do you have
- what dishes do you deliver
- entrees available for delivery 

Select **Save** to save your new topic and then select **Go to authoring canvas** to create your dialog.

In the **Authoring canvas**, create a **Question** node to ask the user about their location. Make sure to select entity **City** from the dropdown list in the **Identity** field.

Rename the output variable **Var** to **user_city**. Set the variable **Usage** to **Bot (any topic can access)** and **Save** the topic.

Next, you will enhance the topic **Meal delivery options** to show the images of the meal choices available in your userâ€™s city by extending your bot with Bot Framework Composer content. Go back to the **Topics** page and select **Open in Bot Framework Composer** and then the **+ New topic** dropdown menu to launch Bot Framework Composer.

Your Power Virtual Agents bot will open in a Bot Framework Composer project. You will see the list of all Power Virtual Agents topics in your bot in Composer, but they are not editable. The **Recognizer Type** field is set to **Default Recognizer**, which is **Power Virtual Agents NLU**.

>[!TIP]
>The **LUIS** service is not supported as a Recognizer for Power Virtual Agents in Composer. The **Default Recognizer** is set to **Power Virtual Agents NLU** instead. You do not need to have an additional subscription to use **Power Virtual Agents NLU** because it is included in your Power Virtual Agents license.

Go to the **Create** tab in Composer and select **Add a dialog** in the dropdown menu:

:::image type="content" source="media/Composer_Example1/E1_Meals_creatNewDialog.png" alt-text="Composer Create tab.":::

Name your new dialog **Meals**. Select **OK** to create a new dialog, **Meals**, in Composer. You will use this **Bot Framework dialog** to display an Adaptive Card.

:::image type="content" source="media/Composer_Example1/E1_Meals_newDialog.png" alt-text="Composer Create tab new dialog.":::

Go to the **Bot Responses** tab in Composer and open the **Meals** section. Select **Show code**.

In the code window, copy and paste the following LG templates that you will use in your Adaptive Card:
```JSON
# Chicken()
-Chicken

# Steak()
-Steak

# Tofu()
-Tofu

# SteakImageURL()
-https://contososcubademo.azurewebsites.net/assets/steak.jpg
# ChickenImageURL()
-https://contososcubademo.azurewebsites.net/assets/chicken.jpg
# TofuImageURL()
-https://contososcubademo.azurewebsites.net/assets/tofu.jpg

```

:::image type="content" source="media/Composer_Example1/E1_Meals_BotResponse_data.png" alt-text="Composer Bot Responses tab with strings.":::

Next, add the Adaptive Card by adding the following JSON code to the same window. This Adaptive Card takes a parameter and displays a set of three images based on the image URLs.

:::image type="content" source="media/Composer_Example1/E1_Meals_BotReponse_JSON.png" alt-text="Composer Bot Responses tab - Adaptive Card JSON.":::

Add the **Activity** that will display this Adaptive Card in the Bot Framework dialog to the same window in Composer:

```JSON
# AdaptiveCardMeals(location)
[Activity
    Attachments = ${json(adaptivecardjson_meals(location))}
]

```

:::image type="content" source="media/Composer_Example1/E1_Meals_BotResponse_Activity.png" alt-text="Composer Bot Responses tab - Activity.":::

Go back to the **Create** tab in Composer and select the **Meals** dialog. Select **BeginDialog** and add **Send a response** to your dialog. We'll use this node to display the Adaptive Card we have created in the **Bot Responses** tab.

For the new **Send a response** action, the **Language Generation** panel will open on the side in Composer. Select **Show code** and add the following expression to this window to show the Adaptive Card, and pass a Power Virtual Agents global variable `user_city` as a parameter: 

```JSON
- ${AdaptiveCardMeals(virtualagent.user_city)}
```

:::image type="content" source="media/Composer_Example1/E1_Meals_AddResponse.png" alt-text="Composer Begin Dialog - add Send a response action.":::

>[!TIP]
>You can [access Power Virtual Agents global variables in Composer](advanced-bot-framework-composer.md#use-and-update-power-virtual-agents-variables-in-bot-framework-composer) by referencing the scope **virtualagent**. For example, **${virtualagent.user_city}** will refer to the value of a variable that was created in the Power Virtual Agents bot.


You are now ready to upload the **Meals** dialog to your Power Virtual Agents bot. Select the **Publish** tab and then the **Publish profile** of your bot, and choose **Publish to selected profile**. Add an optional comment and select **Okay** in the confirmation window to start uploading.

:::image type="content" source="media/Composer_Example1/E1_Meals_Publish.png" alt-text="Composer Publish Example 1 publish.":::

The Composer content will be validated by Power Virtual Agents and a successful publish will be reported in Composer.

>[!Note]
>Selecting **Publish** in Composer does not automatically publish your Power Virtual Agents bot to channels.  
>Use the [Publish](publication-fundamentals-publish-channels.md) feature in Power Virtual Agents to publish your bot changes to channels.

Go to the Power Virtual Agents **Topics** page to see your new Bot Framework content. Your new **Meals** Bot Framework dialog is now shown on the **Topics** page as part of your Power Virtual Agents bot.

:::image type="content" source="media/Composer_Example1/E1_Meals_in_PVA_Topics.png" alt-text="Power Virtual Agents Topics page - new Bot Framework dialog.":::

Open the **Meal delivery options** topic in the **Authoring canvas** in Power Virtual Agents. Under the **Question** node, add a new **Go to another topic** node, and choose the Bot Framework dialog **Meals** from the list of available topics. Note that you can continue building your dialog in Power Virtual Agents after calling a Bot Framework Composer dialog if you wish.

Your Power Virtual Agents topic **Meal delivery options** will call the Bot Framework dialog **Meals** to display an Adaptive Card. Select **Save** to save the changes to your topic.

:::image type="content" source="media/Composer_Example1/E1_MealsDelivery_RedirectToMeals.png" alt-text="Power Virtual Agents - redirect to Bot Framework dialog.":::

To test your changes in Power Virtual Agents, open the **Test pane** and make sure **Track between topics** is turned on. Type in the following text to start your conversation:

- **What meals do you deliver?**
