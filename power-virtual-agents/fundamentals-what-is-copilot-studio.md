# Microsoft Copilot Studio overview

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

Microsoft Copilot Studio lets you create powerful AI-powered copilots for a range of requestsâ€”from providing simple answers to common questions to resolving issues requiring complex conversations. Engage with customers and employees in multiple languages across websites, mobile apps, Facebook, Microsoft Teams, or any channel supported by the Azure Bot Framework.

These copilots can be created easily without the need for data scientists or developers. Some of the ways that Copilot Studio copilots are used include:

- COVID-19 infection rate and tracking information.
- Sales help and support issues.
- Opening hours and store information.
- Employee health and vacation benefits.
- Common employee questions for businesses.

Copilot Studio is available as both a standalone web app, and as a discrete app within Teams. Most of the functionality between the two is the same. However, there might be different reasons to choose one version or the other based on the ways you want to use Copilot Studio.
