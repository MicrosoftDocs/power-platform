## Microsoft Copilot Studio for Microsoft Teams plan

Copilot Studio for Teams enables customers to build conversational interfaces within Teams. The copilots can use data stored in Microsoft Dataverse for Teams or many other sources, using the supplied standard connectors.

Capabilities available in the Copilot Studio app in Teams are available as part of select Microsoft 365 subscriptions with Microsoft Power Platform and Teams capabilities, excluding plans for US government environments (GCC, GCC High, and DoD), EDU A1, and SUB SKUs.

This table compares key capabilities in the Copilot Studio for Teams plan, which is available in select Microsoft 365 subscriptions, against the standalone Copilot Studio subscription. For a full, comparative list, see the [Microsoft Power Platform Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130).

Also see the [Quotas, limits, and configuration values](requirements-quotas.md) topic for other capacity considerations.

>
> Similarly, usage rights and functionality are part of paid, standalone Power Automate subscriptions serve automation scenarios and cannot be applied to Copilot Studio scenarios.

### Upgrading your license

To access the full range of Copilot Studio capabilities, upgrade your plan to a standalone Copilot Studio subscription.

After you upgrade your license, you can continue using the same copilot in the same environment. Capabilities that were previously only available in a standalone license are now be available. These capabilities might include [billed sessions that require Copilot Studio capacity](analytics-billed-sessions.md).

You can upgrade within the Copilot Studio app for Teams from **Settings** >  **Channels**. Select the apps you want to publish to and you're prompted to upgrade.
