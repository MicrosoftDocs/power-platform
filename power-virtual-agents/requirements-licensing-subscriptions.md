# Licensing for Power Virtual Agents

## Power Virtual Agents for Microsoft Teams plan

Power Virtual Agents for Microsoft Teams enables customers to build conversational interfaces within Microsoft Teams. The chatbots can use data stored in Microsoft Dataverse for Teams or many other sources using the supplied standard connectors.

Capabilities available in the Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams are available as part of select Microsoft 365 subscriptions with Microsoft Power Platform and Microsoft Teams capabilities, excluding plans for US government environments (GCC, GCC High, and DoD) and EDU A1 and SUB SKUs.



This table compares key capabilities in the Power Virtual Agents for Microsoft Teams plan, which is available in select Microsoft 365 subscriptions, against the standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription. For a full list of difference, see the [Microsoft Power Platform Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130).

Also see the [Quotas, limits, and configuration values](requirements-quotas.md) topic for other capacity considerations.


Capability | Select Microsoft 365 subscriptions | Power Virtual Agents subscription

Power Automate connectors | [Standard connectors available for flows triggered from Power Virtual Agents](teams/advanced-flow-teams.md) | [Premium connectors available for flows triggered from Power Virtual Agents](advanced-flow.md)
Web security | [Secure access enabled by default, no ability to generate secrets to enable secure access](teams/configure-web-security-teams.md) | [Ability to generate secrets and turn on or off secure access as wanted by the bot author](configure-web-security.md)
Use Microsoft Bot Framework skills | Not available | [Ability to extend Power Virtual Agents bots with Microsoft Bot Framework skills](advanced-use-skills.md)

>[!NOTE]
>A paid, standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription is required to run flows with premium connectors in the context of Power Virtual Agents chatbots.  
Similarly, use rights and functionality available as part of paid, standalone Power Automate subscriptions serve automation scenarios and cannot be applied to Power Virtual Agents scenarios.

### Upgrading your license
To access the full range of Power Virtual Agents capabilities, you need to upgrade your plan to a standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription. 

After you upgrade your license, you can continue using the same bot in the same environment. Capabilities that were previously only available in a standalone license will now be available. These capabilities may include those that result in [billed sessions that require Power Virtual Agents capacity](analytics-billed-sessions.md)).

You can upgrade from within the Power Virtual Agents app for Microsoft Teams when prompted, as in the following example when publishing to other channels:

You can also [start a 60 day free trial of Power Virtual Agents](https://aka.ms/trypva) to try out all the capabilities. You'll be prompted to sign up for a trial if you try to create a bot without a license.

:::image type="content" source="media/upgrade-create.png" alt-text="You are prompted to start a free trial or upgrade to a premium when creating a bot without a license.":::

>[!NOTE]
>The option to create a free trial may be disabled. For more information, see the [Self-service sign-up disabled section](sign-up-individual.md#self-service-sign-up-disabled).

## Standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription
The standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription allows you to build chatbots on any supported channel and connect to any data using premium connectors. 

You can obtain a standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription from the Microsoft 365 admin center. Learn more at the [Assign licenses and manage access to Power Virtual Agents](requirements-licensing.md) topic.
