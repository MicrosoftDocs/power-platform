# Licensing for Power Virtual Agents

This topic includes details about Power Virtual Agents Licensing. You can also review the [Power Platform Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130) to learn more.

## Power Virtual Agents for Microsoft Teams plan


Power Virtual Agents for Microsoft Teams enables customers to build conversational interfaces within Microsoft Teams. The chatbots can use data stored in Project Oakdale or many other sources using the supplied standard connectors.

Capabilities available in the Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams are available as part of select Microsoft 365 subscriptions with Power Platform and Teams capabilities, excluding plans for US government environments (GCC, GCC High and DoD) and EDU A1 and SUB SKUs.

The following table is a brief comparison of capabilities in the Power Virtual Agents for Microsoft Teams plan, which is available in select Microsoft 365 subscriptions, against the standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription. 


Capability | Select Microsoft 365 subscriptions | Power Virtual Agents subscription
--|--|--
Deploy bot to channels | [Microsoft Teams](teams/publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams-teams.md) | [Any channel supported by Power Virtual Agents](publication-fundamentals-publish-channels.md)
Power Automate connectors | [Standard connectors available for flows triggered from Power Virtual Agents](teams/advanced-flow-teams.md) | [Premium connectors available for flows triggered from Power Virtual Agents](advanced-flow.md)
Web security | [Secure access enabled by default, no ability to generate secrets to enable secure access](teams/configure-web-security-teams.md) | [Ability to generate secrets and turn on or off secure access as wanted by the bot author](configure-web-security.md)
Azure bot framework skills | Not available | [Ability to extend Power Virtual Agents bots with Azure bot framework skills](advanced-use-skills.md)


### Upgrading your license
To access the full range of Power Virtual Agents capabilities, you need to upgrade your plan to a standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription. 

You can upgrade from within the Power Virtual Agents app for Microsoft Teams when prompted, as in the following example when publishing to additional channels:

You can also [start a 60 day free trial of Power Virtual Agents](https://aka.ms/trypva) to try out all the capabilities. You'll be prompted to sign up for a trial if you try to create a bot without a license.

>[!NOTE]
>The option to create a free trial may be disabled. For more information, see the [Self-service sign-up disabled section](sign-up-individual.md#self-service-sign-up-disabled).

## Standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription
The standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription allows you to build chatbots on any supported channel and connect to any data using premium connectors. 


You can obtain a standalone Power Virtual Agents subscription from the Microsoft 365 admin center. Learn more at the [Assign licenses and manage access to Power Virtual Agents](requirements-licensing.md) topic.
