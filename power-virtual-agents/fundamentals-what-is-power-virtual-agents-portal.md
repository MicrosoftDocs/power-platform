# Power Virtual Agents portal overview


Power Virtual Agents lets you create powerful chatbots that can be created with a guided, no-code graphical interface - and without the need for data scientists or developers.

The benefits of using a no-code graphical interface help to:

- Eliminate the gap between subject matter experts and development teams building the bots
- Reduce the time from when bot builders and owners recognize an issue to when it can be updated
- Remove the need to understand complex conversational AI systems and methodologies
- Simplify the need for complex code
- Minimize the IT effort needed to deploy and maintain a custom conversational solution

Using Power Virtual Agents, you can:

- **Empower your teams** by allowing them to easily build bots themselves without needing intermediaries, or coding or AI expertise.
- **Reduce costs** by easily automating common inquiries and freeing human agent time to deal with more complex issues.
- **Improve customer satisfaction** by allowing customers to self-help and resolve issues quickly 24/7 using rich personalized bot conversations.

1. **Enable rich, natural conversations.** Microsoft's powerful conversational AI capabilities enable your end users to have rich multi-turn conversations that quickly guide them to the right solution. And, unlike most products on the market, there's no need to retrain AI models. Simply provide a few short examples of the topic you want the bot to handle, build the conversation using our graphical editor and your bot is ready to handle customer requests about it. You can even try out your changes in real-time in the test pane!

1. **Enable bots to take action.** Bots that can chat with your users are great, but bots that can act on their behalf are even better. With Power Virtual Agents, you can easily integrate with services and back-end systems out-of-the-box or through hundreds of easy-to-add custom connectors using Power Automate. This makes it simple to create a bot that not only responds to the user, but also takes action on their behalf.

1. **Monitor and improve bot performance.** Power Virtual Agents lets you keep an eye on how your bots are performing using powerful metrics and AI-driven dashboards. Easily see which topics are doing well and where the bot can improve, and quickly make adjustments to improve performance.

1. **Better together.** Power Virtual Agents works hand-in-hand with [Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/ai/customer-service-insights) to provide a holistic view of your customer service operations. You can use Customer Service Insights and Power Virtual Agents together to determine which topics are trending or consuming support resources, and then easily automate them.

# [Teams](#tab/teams)


Power Virtual Agents is available as an app within Microsoft Teams, which means you can easily create your own chatbots that answer questions posed by other employees or team members.

You can add the Power Virtual Agents app from the Microsoft Teams app store and begin to create, author, test, and publish your bot directly into teams, all within the Microsoft Teams interface. You can also visit [https://aka.ms/PVAForTeams](https://aka.ms/PVAForTeams) to directly install or open the app.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> See the [Important information](#important-information) section for specific usage details.

Because Power Virtual Agents is fully integrated as an app, you can apply Teams settings, such as high contrast and dark mode [under Teams **Settings**](https://support.microsoft.com/office/change-settings-in-teams-b506e8f1-1a96-4cf1-8c6b-b6ed4f424bc7#bkmk_howdoienablehighcontrastmode).

Some of the scenarios where you might want to create a Power Virtual Agents chatbot in Microsoft Teams include:

- Someone in the payroll department creates a chatbot that helps teammates get tax filing forms and information
- The facilities manager creates a chatbot that answers the common questions they are receiving about coming back to work after a pandemic.
- A human resources (HR) employee creates a bot that can answer questions about vacation balance, time off, and benefits.
- A member of the finance department creates a chatbot that helps their teammates in the finance team to fill out expense reports

The Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams makes it easy to fulfill any scenario, especially those that arise within an organization. If you're looking to create a chatbot you can share externally, such as one that interacts with customers outside your organization, see the [Power Virtual Agents web app version of this topic](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents-portal.md).

With Power Virtual Agents in Microsoft Teams you can:

- [Create bots in seconds](authoring-fundamentals.md)
- Have bots [take actions on someone's behalf](advanced-fundamentals.md)
- [Review and analyze the performance of the bot](analytics-overview.md), such as what questions are being asked the most, and how effective the bot is at understanding and answering questions
