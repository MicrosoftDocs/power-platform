# Integrate with QnA Maker

> [!NOTE]
> [Azure QnA Maker will be retired on 31 March 2025](https://azure.microsoft.com/updates/azure-qna-maker-will-be-retired-on-31-march-2025/). Beginning 1 October 2022, you won't be able to create new QnA Maker resources or knowledge bases. Custom question answering, a feature of Azure Cognitive Service for Language, is the updated version of the QnA Maker service.

[QnA Maker](https://www.qnamaker.ai/) is a cloud-based Natural Language Processing service that allows you to create a natural conversational layer over your data. It imports your content into a knowledge base of question and answer pairs. The import process extracts information about the relationship between the parts of your structured and semi-structured content to imply relationships between the question and answer pairs.

## Prerequisites

- [A Power Virtual Agents bot](authoring-first-bot.md).
- [Configure a fallback topic](authoring-system-fallback-topic.md).
- [A QnA Maker knowledge base](/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/quickstarts/create-publish-knowledge-base).
- [Automate chatbot actions with flows](advanced-flow.md).

## Use QnA Maker in fallback topic

You can use an existing QnA Maker knowledge base in Power Virtual Agents by using a Power Automate flow to connect it to any topic. However it's more useful to connect your knowledge base to your bot's system fallback topic. Questions users ask that aren't covered by other topics can _fallback_ to using content from your knowledge base.

To learn how to use QnA maker in a fallback topic, see [Add your knowledge base to Power Virtual Agents](/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/tutorials/integrate-with-power-virtual-assistant-fallback-topic).
