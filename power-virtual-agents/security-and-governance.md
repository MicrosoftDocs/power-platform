# Copilot Studio security and governance

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

Microsoft Copilot Studio follows the Security Development Lifecycle (SDL). The SDL is a set of strict practices that support security assurance and compliance requirements. Learn more at [Microsoft Security Development Lifecycle Practices](https://www.microsoft.com/securityengineering/sdl/practices).

The Copilot Studio service is governed by your commercial license agreements, including the [Microsoft Product Terms](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2182773) and the [Data Protection Addendum](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2153219). For the location of data processing, refer to the [geographical availability documentation](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/availability-reports/).

The [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter) is the primary resource for Power Platform compliance information. Learn more at [Copilot Studio Compliance Offerings](admin-certification.md).

Furthermore, Power Platform has an extensive set of [Data Loss Prevention features](/power-platform/admin/prevent-data-loss) to help you manage the security of your data. Learn how to [Configure Data Loss Prevention policies for bots](admin-data-loss-prevention.md) in your organization.

To further govern and secure Copilot Studio using generative AI features in your organization, you can do the following,

1.  Disable bot publishing:

    -   Your admin can disable the ability to publish bots with generative answers and actions for your tenant in the **Power Platform admin center**.  

        ![Screenshot showing the option to disable bot publishing.](media/security-governance/disable-bot-publishing.png)

    -   Your admin can disable Copilot for your organization by creating a support request.

3.  [Enable Copilot Studio conversational plugins](copilot-conversational-plugins.md).
