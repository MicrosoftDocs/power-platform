# Data loss prevention example - Block Power Platform Connectors from Microsoft Copilot Studio copilots

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]


You can use data loss prevention (DLP) policies to prevent copilot authors from configuring connectors. This can help prevent data exfiltration.

See the [Configure data loss prevention for Microsoft Copilot Studio](admin-data-loss-prevention.md) article for information about other DLP policy configurations.

## Configure DLP to block Power Platform connectors in the Power Platform admin center

[!INCLUDE [DLP policy starting instructions](includes/dlp-basic-config.md)]

### Add the connector

1. Use the search box to find the connector you are looking to block. You can see connectors that are already blocked on the **Blocked** tab.

1. Select **Next**.

1. Review your policy, then select **Update policy** to apply the DLP changes.

## Confirm policy enforcement

# [Web App](#tab/webapp)

You can confirm that this connector is being used in the DLP policy from Microsoft Copilot Studio.

First, open your bot from the environment where the DLP policy is applied. Go to the authoring canvas, create a new topic, add a **Call an action** node, select **Connectors Preview**, choose your blocked connection and then save your topic.

Navigate to the **Publish** page and, if the policy is enforced, you'll see an error. The error says "Your bot may not work as intended right now due to your organization's data loss prevention policies."

You can choose to click the **Download details** button in the error banner to see granular details of the policy violations and to confirm that the connectors are blocked.
