# Use prebuilt copilot templates in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

> [!NOTE]
> This topic applies to copilots created in the Microsoft Copilot Studio app in Microsoft Teams only. Templates aren't currently supported for the Copilot Studio web app.

Copilots help your employees to self-serve human resources (HR), IT, and other internal employee functions by providing automated responses and taking meaningful actions. This copilot automation increases an employee's efficiency and saves your organization money and time.

You can use templates created by the Copilot Studio team to help you create and customize bots to your needs.

## Employee frequently asked questions (FAQ) template

The Employee FAQ copilot template helps you create a bot to handle your employee's most common questions. The template adds content that matches your business needs.

The template can log an employee's escalation request, notify a human expert, and prompt a quick response to the employeeâ€”all within Teams.

The copilot obtains employee feedback so you can make improvements to the copilot over time.

A copilot can be customized and extended to suit your needs with no developer and data science background required.
