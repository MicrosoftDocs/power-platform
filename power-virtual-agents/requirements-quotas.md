# Quotas, limits, and configuration values for Power Virtual Agents

This topic contains quotas, limits, and configuration values for Power Virtual Agents.

## Quotas

Quotas are default constraints applied to chatbots that limit how often messages can be sent to the chatbot. The purpose of quotas is to throttle the client's service load, which protects a service from being overloaded and the client from unexpected resource usage.

Quotas are applied to your chatbots alongside the capacity constraints you gained by purchasing a [Power Virtual Agents plan](https://powervirtualagents.microsoft.com/pricing). Also see [Licensing and capacity considerations](requirements-licensing.md).

The following quotas, defined as requests per minute (RPM), apply to Power Virtual Agents chatbots. 
  

Action | Quota with the paid plan
--|--
**Messages to a chatbot**<br/>(Includes any message from a user or integrations, such as Azure Bot Framework skills, to a single chatbot.)  | 800 RPM per bot	


If the quota for **messages to a chatbot** is met, the user chatting with the chatbot will see a failure notice when they try to send a message. They'll be prompted to retry.

## Limits


These limits apply to the Power Virtual Agents web app and the Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams.




### Power Virtual Agents web and Teams apps limits




Feature | Web app | Teams app
--|-- | --
Bots | N/A | 50 per team
Topics | 1000 per bot in Dataverse environments | 250 per bot in Dataverse for Teams environments<sup>1</sup> <br/>1000 per bot in Dataverse environments (after upgrade)
Trigger phrases | 200 per topic | 200 per topic
Skills | 100 per bot | 100 per bot


<sup>1</sup> If you're approaching limits in Dataverse for Teams environments, you can [upgrade Dataverse for Teams](teams/admin-upgrade-dataverse-teams.md) to continue adding topics.


### Power Virtual Agents subscription limits

Feature | Standard subscription | Teams (select Microsoft 365 subscriptions)
-- | -- | --
Sessions | N/A | 10 per user every 24 hours across all bots in a tenant<sup>1</sup>
Power Platform requests<sup>2</sup> | 30,000 every 24 hours<sup>3</sup> | 2,000 every 24 hours

<sup>1</sup> Power Virtual Agents [sessions](analytics-sessions.md) that are included with [Microsoft 365 subscriptions](requirements-licensing-subscriptions.md#power-virtual-agents-for-microsoft-teams-plan) aren't pooled.  
<sup>2</sup> These requests are consumed by Power Automate flows that are triggering by Power Virtual Agents chatbots. Learn more about [Power Automate limits](/power-platform/admin/api-request-limits-allocations).  
<sup>3</sup> You can contact your admin to increase the Power Virtual Agents Power Platform requests limits by purchasing the Power Virtual Agents Chat Session add-on. For more information, see the [Microsoft Power Platform Licensing Guide](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2085130).
