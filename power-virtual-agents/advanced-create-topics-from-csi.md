# Create bot topics from Customer Service Insights

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

If you use [Dynamics 365 Customer Service Insights](/dynamics365/ai/customer-service-insights/overview), you can automatically create new [topics](authoring-create-edit-topics.md) in Microsoft Copilot Studio based on your existing [Customer Service Insights support topics](/dynamics365/ai/customer-service-insights/topics-page).

You should review [recommendations for identifying topics for automation](/dynamics365/ai/customer-service-insights/automate-topics#identify-topics-for-automation) in the Customer Service Insights documentation before you begin.

1. In the topic details page, select **Automate** at the top.

1. Customer Service Insights opens a new browser tab and goes to the [Microsoft Copilot Studio web app](https://web.powerva.microsoft.com), where it creates a new topic in the currently active bot.

    The **Name** and **Trigger phrases** are prefilled from the topic you selected for automation.

    Customer Service Insights prefills **Trigger phrases** with non-duplicated case titles from the most relevant cases (up to three cases).

1. Review the topic name and trigger phrases, and follow the other steps in the [Create custom topics for your bot](authoring-create-edit-topics.md) article to complete the creation of your bot topic.

## Automate topics from the Topics page

You can also automate topics from the Topics page by hovering over the topic you want to automate in the topic list, then selecting the **Automate** icon.
