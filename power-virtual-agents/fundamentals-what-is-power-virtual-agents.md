# Power Virtual Agents overview

>[!IMPORTANT]
>See the [Important information](#important-information) section for specific usage details.

Power Virtual Agents lets you create powerful chatbots that can answer questions posed by your customers, other employees, or visitors to your website or service. 

These bots can be created easily without the need for data scientists or developers. Some of the ways that Power Virtual Agents bots have been used include:

- COVID-19 infection rate and tracking information
- Sales help and support issues
- Opening hours and store information
- Employee health and vacation benefits
- Common employee questions for businesses

Power Virtual Agents is available as both a standalone web app, and as a discrete app within Microsoft Teams. Most of the functionality between the two is the same. However, there might be different reasons to choose one version or the other based on the ways you want to use Power Virtual Agents.
