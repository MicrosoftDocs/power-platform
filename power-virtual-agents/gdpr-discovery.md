[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The first step in responding to a data subject rights request is to search for and identify the customer data that is the subject of the request. Microsoft provides capabilities that assist you in responding to data subject rights requests, and thereby accessing customer data. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that personal data is located and classified appropriately.

The following table summarizes the types of Power Virtual Agents resources that contain personal data for a specific user.
