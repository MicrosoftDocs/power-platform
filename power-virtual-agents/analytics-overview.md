### Analytics in Microsoft Copilot Studio

In Microsoft Copilot Studio, in the navigation menu, select **Analytics**.

The analytics section is divided into a number of pages to give you multiple ways to understand bot performance.

The following terms are used in this section.

- A _conversation_ is an ongoing interaction between a specific user, or group of users, on a channel and your bot. Conversations can pause and resume later, or be transferred to a live agent. The conversation may be one-way, either from the end user to the bot, or from the bot to the end user, but is more commonly a back-and-forth interaction between the end user and the bot.
- _Analytics sessions_ track user engagement for your bot. Analytics sessions try to capture how well your bot handles user tasks.
- _Billed sessions_ are used to measure resource consumption. Billed sessions are independent of analytics sessions.

> [!NOTE]
> Transcripts are available for download about 20 minutes after an analytic session _ends_, as conversation transcripts in Dataverse via the Power Apps portal and as session chat transcripts via the Microsoft Copilot Studio app. It can take up to an hour after the analytic session _ends_  before the appearing in the analytics dashboard.
