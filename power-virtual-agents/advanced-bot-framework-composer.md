# Overview of Bot Framework Composer

[!INCLUDE [Composer integrated with PVA](includes/composer-integrated-with-pva.md)]

Enhance your bot by developing custom topics with [Bot Framework Composer](/composer/) and then adding them to your Power Virtual Agents bot.

Composer is integrated into Power Virtual Agents to allow developers and business users to build bots together. Composer lets you extend your bot with Bot Framework functionality, including:

- Adaptive dialogs
- Language Generation (LG)
- Regular expressions (RegEx)
- Adaptive Cards

Using Composer with Power Virtual Agents lets you access conversational memory and context, including the variables defined in Power Virtual Agents. This lets you create topics to handle interruptions, cancellations, and context switching. You can also add Adaptive Cards to display interactive elements like images and videos, forms, and more in the bot.

There are various prebuilt functions and expressions in Composer for you to use, and the ability to define multiple variations of a phrase for the bot to randomly select at runtime.

Custom topics added with Composer are deployed, hosted, and executed together with the rest of Power Virtual Agents bot content, and don't require any more Azure hosting.

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Power Virtual Agents](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).
- [Introduction to Bot Framework Composer](/composer/introduction)

## Understand key Composer terms

Composer uses a different set of terms to describe similar concepts used in Power Virtual Agents. Below is a list of key terms to understand:

- **dialog:** Dialogs are the basic building block in Composer and serve as containers for triggers. Each dialog represents a portion of the bot's functionality that contains instructions for what the bot will do and how it will react to user input. To learn more about dialogs, see [Dialogs as conversational building blocks in Composer](/composer/concept-dialog).

- **main dialog:** A bot's main dialog is the first dialog that appears in the bot explorer and is created when you import your Power Virtual Agent bot into Composer. The main dialog should never be deleted, as it corresponds to your Power Virtual Agents bot.

- **trigger:** Triggers are the main component of a dialog and let you catch and respond to events. Each trigger has a condition and a collection of actions to execute when the condition is met. You can think of triggers as the equivalent of _topics_ in Power Virtual Agents. To learn more about triggers, see [Triggers](/composer/concept-events-and-triggers).

- **action:** Actions are the main components of a trigger that enable you to send a response, create and assign values to properties, manipulate the conversational flow, manage dialogs, and many other activities. You can think of actions as the equivalent of _nodes_ in Power Virtual Agents.

## Composer features not supported with Power Virtual Agents

The following Composer features aren't supported with Power Virtual Agents:

| Unsupported feature                             | Additional information                                                                              |

| Dialog Inputs and Outputs                       | Dialog Inputs and Outputs aren't supported in Composer for Power Virtual Agents.                   |
| Entity detection in trigger phrases in Composer | Can't use `# getUserName my name is {username=userName}` in Composer.                              |
| Testing in Bot Framework Emulator               | All Composer content should be published and then tested in Power Virtual Agents.                   |

## Guidelines for creating bot content for Power Virtual Agents in Composer

There are a few key guidelines to follow when using Composer to create your bot content for Power Virtual Agents:

- The topics from your Power Virtual Agents bot will be displayed in Composer as dialogs. You can't edit these dialogs in Composer; selecting them will open the relevant topics in Power Virtual Agents for editing.

    :::image type="content" source="media/advanced-bot-framework-composer/pva-topics-in-composer.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the list of topics in Composer that were imported from a Power Virtual Agents bot.":::

- Power Virtual Agents global variables are accessed in Composer by using the `virtualagent` scope. This scope won't appear in Composer's property reference menu, but you can access it by entering an expression directly.

- Publishing content in Composer makes the changes available for testing, but does not automatically publish your Power Virtual Agents bot. Use the [Publish](publication-fundamentals-publish-channels.md) feature in Power Virtual Agents to publish your bot changes to channels.

- Use a **Begin a Power Virtual Agents Topic** action to call Power Virtual Agents topics in Composer.

    :::image type="content" source="media/advanced-bot-framework-composer/Gd_call_PVA_Topic.png" alt-text="Screenshot of Composer's add action menu.":::

- You can add new Composer triggers of any kind to your main (also known as "root") dialog.

- You can send messages and ask questions from these Composer triggers.

- You can't use the Regular expression recognizer in the main dialog. Using the Regular expression recognizer in the main dialog will prevent you from publishing your Composer content to Power Virtual Agents. However, you can use the Regular expression recognizer in any other Composer dialog.

- You can add any Composer events and triggers to newly created dialogs.

- On the **Bot Responses** page, the **Common** section should be empty. Using any assets there will result in validation errors and prevent you from publishing your Composer content to Power Virtual Agents.

    :::image type="content" source="media/advanced-bot-framework-composer/common-empty.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the common bot responses section empty.":::

- Each Composer dialog has its own bot response (.lg) and language understanding (.lu) resources. For example, a bot that speaks English (US) and has a dialog named `dialog1` will have one `dialog1.en-us.lg` file and one `dialog1.en-us.lu` file.

- The main dialog in Composer should never be deleted, as it corresponds to your Power Virtual Agents bot. The main dialog can have zero or more triggers.

- You can capture telemetry in Composer dialogs and triggers and use [Application Insights](/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) to analyze it with [Kusto queries for adaptive dialogs](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-telemetry-analytics-queries?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true#adaptive-dialogs-started-and-completed). For more information, see [Capture telemetry with Application Insights](advanced-bot-framework-composer-capture-telemetry.md).
