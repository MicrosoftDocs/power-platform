# Key concepts - Enhanced authoring in Microsoft Copilot Studio

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

You can go beyond basic authoring in Microsoft Copilot Studio by taking advantage of a number of advanced features. 

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Microsoft Copilot Studio](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).


# [Web app](#tab/web)

These features enhance and improve upon the [authoring experience](authoring-fundamentals.md) by letting you:

- Expand the types of information the bot understands and can parse back.
- Use variables to retrieve information from one part of a topic and use it in another, to ensure a consistent experience for your bot users.
- Utilize existing support content from website pages, such as FAQ pages, to quickly create a robust set of topics that can be used in a bot.
- Allow users to sign in directly within a bot, and then use that authentication to retrieve information from backend systems.
- Use advanced Power Automate flows to retrieve and send information to other databases.
- Add special nodes that take the context of the entire bot conversation and share it with a human help support agent.
