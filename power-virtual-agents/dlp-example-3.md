# Data loss prevention example - Require end-user authentication for Microsoft Copilot Studio copilots

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

The Microsoft Copilot Studio bot comes with the **Only for Teams and Power Apps** authentication option turned on. The bot automatically uses Microsoft Entra ID authentication for Teams and Power Apps without requiring any manual setup and only lets you chat with your bot on Teams. However, bot makers in your organization can select **No authentication** authentication option to allow anyone with the link to chat with your bot.

You can use data loss prevention (DLP) policies to block your bot makers from configuring and publishing chatbots that aren't configured for authentication to help prevent data exfiltration.

Bot makers will need to [configure end-user authentication with Teams or Microsoft Entra ID in Microsoft Copilot Studio](configuration-end-user-authentication.md) if you use this connector in an enforced DLP policy.

See the [Configure data loss prevention for Microsoft Copilot Studio chatbots](admin-data-loss-prevention.md) topic for information about other DLP-related connectors.

1. Select **Next**.

1. If you're a tenant admin, or an environment admin for multiple environments, you'll see the **Scope** step. Choose one or more environments that your DLP policy will apply to.

## Confirm policy enforcement in Microsoft Copilot Studio

You can confirm that this connector is being used in the DLP policy from the Microsoft Copilot Studio web app.

First, open your bot from the environment where the DLP policy is applied.

If the policy is enforced, you'll see an error banner with a **Go to Authentication** button, and a message advising you to contact an admin or configure authentication.

:::image type="content" source="media/dlp-example-3/policy-enforcement-banner.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the banner that indicates DLP policies are in effect  and that authentication must be configured.":::

The bot maker can select the **Go to Authentication** button to be taken directly to the **Authentication** configuration panel. Here, they'll need to configure **Only for Teams** or **Manual** (**Azure Active Directory** or **Azure Active Directory v2**) for the end-user to chat with the bot.
