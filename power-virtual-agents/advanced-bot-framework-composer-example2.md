# Example 2 - Display a multi-select options list in Power Virtual Agents

[!INCLUDE [Composer integrated with PVA](includes/composer-integrated-with-pva.md)]

Enhance your bot by developing custom dialogs with [Bot Framework Composer](/composer/) and then adding them to your Power Virtual Agents bot.

In this example, you'll learn how to display a multi-select list in Power Virtual Agents by using Composer.

[!INCLUDE [Composer License](includes/composer-license.md)]

1. Open your bot in Composer. For instructions on how to do so, see [Getting started with Bot Framework Composer](advanced-bot-framework-composer-fundamentals.md#open-your-bot-in-composer).

1. In Composer, go to the **Create** page. In your bot, select **More options** (**...**) then select **+ Add a dialog**. For **Name** enter `DailySpecials`.

1. In your new **DailySpecials** dialog, select the **BeginDialog** trigger to open the authoring canvas.

1. On the authoring canvas, select **Add** (**+**), **Manage properties**, and **Set a property**.
