# Test your Power Virtual Agents bot

As you design your bot in Power Virtual Agents, you can use the **Test bot** pane to see how the bot leads a customer through the bot conversation.

To help you find and fix unexpected behavior, you can enable tracking between topics to take you through the bot conversation step-by-step, and go to the corresponding node in the authoring canvas.

## Prerequisites
