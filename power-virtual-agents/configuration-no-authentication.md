# Disable default authentication for Microsoft Copilot Studio copilots

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

You can configure anyone to chat with your copilot or bot by removing or changing the default authentication configuration that is automatically enabled when bots and copilots are created. 

>[!NOTE]
> Bots created in the web app and in Microsoft Teams come with authentication pre-configured to use **Only for Teams and Power Apps** authentication.

You can also configure single sign-on (SSO) so your users don't need to sign in manually. For more information, see [Configure SSO for web](configure-sso.md).

Read more about authentication options for when people interact with your bot or copilot in the [Configure end-user authentication](configuration-end-user-authentication.md) article.

# [Web app](#tab/web)

The bot comes with the **Only for Teams and Power Apps** authentication option turned on. The bot automatically uses Microsoft Entra ID authentication for Teams and Power Apps without requiring any manual setup, and only lets you chat with your bot on Teams. 

If you want to allow anyone to chat with your bot, select **No authentication** in the **Security** settings for your bot or copilot. If you want to use other channels and still have authentication for your bot, select **Manual** authentication.

You can further configure user authentication within a topic to [allow your bot and copilot users to sign in right in the conversation](advanced-end-user-authentication.md). You can then personalize the conversation with user variables and access back-end systems on the user's behalf.


# [Classic](#tab/classic)

### Authentication variables

Classic bots have the **No authentication** authentication option turned on by default, so  anyone can chat with the bot without authenticating. 

If your bot is configured with either **Only for Teams and Power Apps** or **Manual** authentication options, you will have a set of authentication variables available in your topics. Check the [authentication configuration documentation](configuration-end-user-authentication.md) for more information on how to configure authentication in your bot.
