# Key concepts - Use Power Automate flows in Power Virtual Agents

Extend the capabilities of your bot with [cloud flows](/power-automate/overview-cloud) that you build in [Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) using low-code, drag-and-drop tools. You can use flows that already exist in your [Power Apps environment](environments-first-run-experience.md) or create a flow from the [Power Virtual Agents authoring canvas](authoring-create-edit-topics.md). Call bot-ready flows from bot topics as a discrete **Call an action** node.
