# Analyze your bot's customer satisfaction metrics

The **Customer Satisfaction** tab on the **Analytics** page provides a detailed view of customer satisfaction (CSAT) survey data, including the average CSAT score over time and the topics that are having the most impact on the CSAT score. This page includes various charts with graphical views of your bot's customer satisfaction indicators.

The **Customer satisfaction drivers** chart shows you the topics that are having the most impact on customer satisfaction.

By default, the page shows you key performance indicators for the last seven days. To change the time period, use the date-time pickers at the top of the page. You can retrieve data for any period within the last 45 days.

## Customer satisfaction drivers

The **Customer satisfaction drivers** chart uses AI to group related support cases as topics. This chart then displays topics in order of their impact on customer satisfaction over the specified time period. The report only lists topics that have had at least one survey response within the report period.

| Description | Details |
| --- | --- |
| Topic | A Power Virtual Agents topic. |
| Engaged sessions | The number of engaged sessions for the topic within the specified time period. |
| Resolution rate | The percentage of engaged sessions for the topic that are resolved. |
| Abandon rate | The percentage of engaged sessions for the topic that are abandoned. |
| Escalation rate | The percentage of engaged sessions for the topic that are escalated. |
| Avg CSAT | The average CSAT survey score for the topic. |
| Impact | The topic's customer-satisfaction impact score. The customer-satisfaction impact score is the overall average CSAT survey score including the topic minus the overall average CSAT survey score excluding the topic. |

The chart displays the impact score. Topics with a positive impact percentage are topics with a higher than average CSAT survey score&mdash;they increased the overall score of your bot.

Increase the average CSAT survey score of topics with high negative impact percentages to more quickly improve the overall CSAT score for your bot.

To see additional information about each topic, select the **Detail** link to display the topic details page. For more information, see the [Topic details page](analytics-topic-details.md).

## Average CSAT score

The CSAT survey asks customers to rate their experience on a scale of on a scale of 1 to 5. If an end user responds to more than one survey in the same analytic session, only the most last value is used.

## CSAT survey response rate
