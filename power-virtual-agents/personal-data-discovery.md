# Responding to personal data discovery requests from data subjects

The first step in responding to a data subject rights request is to search for and identify the customer data that is the subject of the request. Microsoft provides capabilities that assist you in responding to data subject rights requests, and thereby accessing customer data. However, it is your responsibility to ensure that personal data is located and classified appropriately.

The following table summarizes the types of Power Virtual Agents resources that contain personal data for a specific user.

| Resources containing personal data | Purpose                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Telemetry logs                     | Logging that captures historical events within the service. |
| Bot content and settings           | Information such as content topics and bot settings.        |
| User settings                      | Settings specific to the user of the bot.                   |
| Conversation logs                  | Used to calculate bot metrics and analytics.                |
| Aggregated metrics                 | Used to determine bot behavior.                             |
