# Add bot to Facebook

You can add your bot to Facebook Messenger to use the Facebook experience to engage with your end users.

Facebook Messenger and related services are subject to Facebook's own terms and conditions. For support related to Facebook Messenger, contact Facebook directly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article is intended for experienced IT professionals who manage your organization's Facebook page.

> [!NOTE]
> By publishing your bot to a Facebook page, some of your data such as bot content and end-user chat content will be shared with Facebook (meaning that your data will flow outside of your [organization's compliance and geographic or regional boundaries](data-location.md)).  
> For more information, see [Facebook's Platform Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/policy-overview).

### Submit for Facebook review

You need to submit your app for Facebook review before you can make your Facebook app public. Facebook requires a Privacy Policy URL and Terms of Service URL. You need to provide those on the Facebook basic app settings page (after signing in to your app at [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/), select **Basic** under **Settings** on the side menu pane).

The [Code of Conduct](https://investor.fb.com/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct/default.aspx) page contains third-party resources to help create a privacy policy. The [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php) page contains sample terms to help create an appropriate Terms of Service document.

Facebook has its own [review process](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/app-review) for apps that are published to Messenger. You can learn more about it at [Sample submissions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/sample-submissions/) and [Common rejection reasons](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/common-rejection-reasons/). Your bot will be tested to ensure it is compliant with [Facebook's Platform Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/policy-overview) before approved by Facebook to become public.

### Make the app public and publish the page

Until the app is published, it is in [Development Mode](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/managing-development-cycle). The bot will not be public and it will work only for admins, developers, and testers.

After the review is successful, in the app's **Dashboard** under **App Review**, set the app to **Public**. Ensure that the Facebook Page associated with the bot is published. The status appears in the **Pages** settings.

## Remove your bot from Facebook Messenger

When you do not want the bot to be reachable in Facebook Messenger, you can remove the bot from Facebook.

1. In Power Virtual Agents, in the navigation menu under **Settings**, select **Channels**.

1. Select the **Facebook** tile and then **Delete**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/publication-add-bot-to-facebook/channel-fb-delete-channel.png" alt-text="Delete Facebook channel." border="false":::

## Updating bot content for existing conversations on Facebook

To prevent disruptions during a chat between a user and the bot, existing conversations will not be updated to the latest bot content immediately after a new publish. Instead, the content will be updated after the conversation has been idle for 30 minutes.

New conversations between user and the bot will have the latest published bot content.

## Known limitations

- You will need to create a new bot if the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) survey shows up as a non-interactable card image for a bot created during public preview to access the latest CSAT content.
- It might take a few minutes before the bot becomes reachable by users on Facebook pages after the Facebook channel is added.
- After removing the Facebook channel, it might take a few minutes before the bot is removed fully and becomes unreachable on Facebook Messenger.
- After removing a Facebook page, it might take a few minutes before the bot becomes unreachable by visitors to the removed page through Facebook Messenger.
