# Add bot to Facebook

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

You can add your bot to either Facebook Messenger or Facebook Workplace to use the Facebook experience to engage with your end users.

Facebook Messenger, Facebook Workplace, and related services are subject to Facebook's own terms and conditions.  For support related to Facebook Messenger and Facebook Workplace, contact Facebook directly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This article is intended for experienced IT professionals who manage your organization's Facebook page and Facebook Workplace.

> [!NOTE]
> By publishing your bot to a Facebook page, some of your data such as bot content and end-user chat content will be shared with Facebook (meaning that your data will flow outside of your [organizationâ€™s compliance and geographic or regional boundaries](data-location.md)). <br/>
> For more information, see [Facebook's Platform Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/policy-overview).

## Add bot to Facebook Messenger
You need a Facebook app, and an associated developer account, to connect your Power Virtual Agents bot to Facebook Messenger on your Facebook pages. 

These are the steps involved in this process:

2. Configure the Facebook publication channel in Power Virtual Agents.

3. Connect your Facebook app to Power Virtual Agents (by using webhooks).

You will then need to submit your app for Facebook review before you can publish your app and make it public.

### Submit for Facebook review

You need to submit your app for Facebook review before you can make your Facebook app public.  Facebook requires a Privacy Policy URL and Terms of Service URL.  You need to provide those on the Facebook basic app settings page (after signing in to your app at [Facebook for Developers](https://developers.facebook.com/), select **Basic** under **Settings** on the side menu panel).

The [Code of Conduct](https://investor.fb.com/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct/default.aspx) page contains third-party resources to help create a privacy policy. The [Terms of Service](https://www.facebook.com/terms.php) page contains sample terms to help create an appropriate Terms of Service document.

Facebook has its own [review process](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/app-review) for apps that are published to Messenger. You can learn more about it at [Sample submissions](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/sample-submissions/) and [Common rejection reasons](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/review/common-rejection-reasons/). Your bot will be tested to ensure it is compliant with [Facebook's Platform Policies](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/policy-overview) before approved by Facebook to become public. 

### Make the app public and publish the page
Until the app is published, it is in [Development Mode](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/managing-development-cycle). The bot will not be public and it will work only for admins, developers, and testers.

After the review is successful, in the app's **Dashboard** under **App Review**, set the app to **Public**. Ensure that the Facebook Page associated with the bot is published. The status appears in the **Pages** settings.

## Add your bot to Facebook Workplace
[Facebook Workplace](https://workplace.facebook.com/help/work/) is the business-to-employee version of Facebook.

To add your bot to Facebook Workplace, you'll need information from your Facebook Workplace Advanced account and Power Virtual Agents. 

You also need to be the administrator of a Facebook Workplace Advanced account to create a custom integration. 

Learn more at [What are the differences between Workplace Standard and Workplace Advanced?](https://www.facebook.com/help/work/289530281467090) and [Facebook Workplace Custom Integrations](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/custom-integrations-new/).

**Create and connect a custom integration:**

1. Sign in to your [Facebook Workplace Advanced](https://www.facebook.com/workplace) account as the administrator.

2. Select **Admin Panel** on the side menu panel and then **Integrations**. Select **Create Custom Integration**.

   ![Create custom integration](media/channel-fb-wp-custom-integration.png)

3. Under **Integration details**, copy and securely store the *App ID*, *App Secret*, and *Access token* (the *Access token* will be used as the page access token). Make sure **Enabled** is set to **Yes**. Under **Integrations Permissions**, make sure **Message any member** is selected.

   ![Get Facebook Workplace custom integration info](media/channel-fb-wp-get-integration-info.png)

4. Navigate to the custom integration page you created in the previous step. You can do this by searching the custom integration's name on the side search bar. Copy the *page ID* of the custom integration from the URL at *my.workplace.com/\{your-integration-name}-\{pageID}/*.

   ![Get Facebook Workplace custom integration page ID](media/channel-fb-wp-get-page-id.png)

5. Follow the steps under [Configure the Facebook channel in Power Virtual Agents](#configure-the-facebook-channel-in-power-virtual-agents) to provide the custom integration information.

**Set up webhooks for Facebook Workplace custom integration:**
1. Return to your Facebook Workplace custom integration settings by selecting **Admin Panel** on the side menu panel and then the custom integration you created.

2. Under the **Configure Webhooks** section, provide the *Callback URL* and *Verify token* from the [Configure the Facebook channel in Power Virtual Agents](#configure-the-facebook-channel-in-power-virtual-agents) section.  Select the **messages**, **messaging_postbacks**, and **message_deliveries** fields. 

   ![Set Facebook Workplace custom integration webhook](media/channel-fb-wp-webhooks.png)

3. Save your custom integration by selecting **Save**.


## Remove your bot from Facebook Messenger or Facebook Workplace
When you do not want the bot to be reachable in Facebook Messenger or Facebook Workplace, you can remove the bot from Facebook. 

1. In Power Virtual Agents, select **Manage** on the side navigation pane, and then go to the **Channels** tab. 

1. Select the **Facebook** tile and then **Delete**.

   ![Delete Facebook channel](media/channel-fb-delete-channel.png)
   
## Updating bot content for existing conversation on Facebook
To prevent disruption on existing conversations between user and the bot, existing conversations will not be updated to latest bot content immediately after new publish until the conversation has been idle over a period of time.  New conversations between user and the bot will have the latest published bot content.

## Known limitations
- You will need to create a new bot if the Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) survey shows up as a non-interactable card image for a bot created during public preview to access the latest CSAT content.
- It might take a few minutes before the bot becomes reachable by users on Facebook pages after the Facebook channel is added.
- After removing the Facebook channel, it might take a few minutes before the bot is removed fully and becomes unreachable on Facebook Messenger and Facebook Workplace.
- After removing a Facebook page, it might take a few minutes before the bot becomes unreachable by visitors to the removed page through Facebook Messenger.
