# Conversational AI project best practices

## Engagement Principles

Adoption of low-code technologies like Power Virtual Agents can help customers envision and deliver quickly with less management and fewer maintenance costs.

Customers approaching a Power Virtual Agents project should align project delivery with their own company culture and objectives. However, there are some core principles that we see adopted again and again amongst successful Power Virtual Agents projects.

## Principles

 | **Engage your flywheel** | **Keep it simple** | **Keep goals in focus** |
 | When the Power Virtual Agents bot goes live, the “customer feedback flywheel” takes effect quickly. Actionable customer feedback comes in almost instantly. Delaying the publishing of your bot for more topics or processes means foregoing valuable user feedback. Encourage the team to see going live as the beginning of your project, not the finale. | One of the core value propositions of Power Virtual Agents is iteratively delivering a conversational AI experience quickly. After the project goes live, maintainability is key to staying agile. Tooling can allow users to create complex conversation flows. However, extensibility with the Bot Framework enables flexible interactions, therefore decide if complexity is always necessary. | It’s easy when implementing new technology, like a chatbot, for developers to focus on the minor details of implementation. Define your key business goals, for example to deflect 30% of customer queries or score above 4.0 customer satisfaction. Goals can keep the project moving and ensure correct feature prioritization.|

## Best practices

1. **Focus on delivering immediate value**

   Building chatbots is an iterative initiative. You learn from your users what they're looking for. Use these observations to drive further investment.

2. **Establish role clarity**  

   Make it clear who's the decision maker, so there's no ambiguity in delivery.

3. **Identify risks early and plan contingency accordingly**

   Occasionally customers run into technical issues when implementing specific requirements or integrating with other systems. These issues can take time to diagnose.

4. **Agree on issue priorities**

   Define a *blocker*, a *must have*, and a *nice to have*. Decide how aggressively you want to push for workarounds, while the underlying issues are addressed. Workarounds are a natural part of projects as they allow the project to make progress, while a longer-term solution is found.

5. **Determine your Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) strategy**

   Move to the production-level process as early as possible. Don’t linger in development phases, when there are timelines to be met.
