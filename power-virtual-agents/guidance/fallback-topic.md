# Using the Fallback topic

The Fallback topic gets triggered When Power Virtual Agents doesn't understand a user utterance and doesn’t have sufficient confidence to trigger any of the existing topics.

There are multiple ways to use the Fallback topic.

## Offloading single question and answer pairs

If you have a large number of question and answer pairs for single-turn conversations, you can also consider offloading them to an external system and access them through the Fallback topic.

Power Virtual Agents limits a chatbot to 1,000 topics. You can decide to manage exceptions to the Power Virtual Agents topics that should generally _do_ things for the end-user through the Fallback topic. With the Fallback topic, you can get answers for end-users that you retrieve from external systems using Power Automate, by [calling a cloud flow from an action node](/power-virtual-agents/advanced-use-flow).

> [!TIP]
> [Question answering in Azure Cognitive Service for Language](/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/question-answering/overview) provides cloud-based natural language processing (NLP) that allows you to create a natural conversational layer over your data. It is used to find the most appropriate answer for any input from your custom knowledge base of information.

## Giving your chatbot a personality

[Question answering in Azure Cognitive Service for Language](/azure/cognitive-services/language-service/question-answering/overview) provides a readily available "chitchat" data source, of various tones such as "professional", "friendly", "witty".

Chitchat lets your chatbot answer trivial questions, such As "_how are you feeling today, bot?_".

## Integrate with generative AI models

You can also use the Fallback topic to call a generative AI model, such as those used by the [Azure OpenAI Service](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview), to handle more questions from your end users.

Through the system prompt and [prompt engineering](/azure/cognitive-services/openai/concepts/prompt-engineering), you can also feed the model with instructions, rules and input data before it generates an answer.

## Learning from the Fallback topic

You should track what your customers are saying that doesn’t trigger a standard Power Virtual Agents topic. The phrases can enrich an existing topic’s trigger phrases, typically when the user utterance should have triggered a topic. The phrases can also lead to the creation of new topics to better serve your users as you understand better what they’re trying to accomplish.
