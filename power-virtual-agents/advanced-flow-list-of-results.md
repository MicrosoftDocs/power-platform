# Return a list of results

It's common to ask a bot to look for data in an external system and return a list of results. To do that, Power Virtual Agents can call a Power Automate flow to:

- authenticate and connect to an external solution
- run a query based on the user's inputs
- format the results
- return the results to the bot

In this example, you'll use the Dataverse connector in Power Automate to search for accounts. Then you'll return a list of results that includes the account name, city, and account number to Power Virtual Agents.

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Power Virtual Agents](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).
- Understand how to [create a flow](advanced-flow-create.md) from the Power Virtual Agents authoring canvas.
- [Add input and output variables](advanced-flow-input-output.md).
- [Configure Dataverse search for your environment](/power-platform/admin/configure-relevance-search-organization).

## Set up a Dataverse Account table

The Account table is a [standard table](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/types-of-entities) that's included automatically in Power Platform environments. However, it doesn't come with account data. Before your bot can search for accounts, you'll need to populate the Account table.

If you already have an Account table with data, skip this step and move on to [Create a topic](#create-a-topic). However, you'll need to use different search terms when you test your bot in later steps.

1. Go to the [Power Apps portal](https://make.powerapps.com/).

1. In the side pane, under **Dataverse**, select **Tables**.

1. Select the **Account** table, and then on the table properties page, select **Edit**.

1. Add the following rows to the table:

    | Address 1: City | Account Name          | Account Number |
    | --------------- | --------------------- | -------------- |
    | Seattle         | Contoso Inc           | AC0125         |
    | San Francisco   | Contoso Residences    | AC0255         |
    | Olympia         | Contoso Meal Delivery | AC0035         |

## Create a topic

1. Go to the [**Topics page**](authoring-create-edit-topics.md) for your bot.

1. Create a topic called **Account Search**.

1. Add the following trigger phrases:
   - I'm looking for a customer
   - I'm looking for an account
   - search account
   - search customer

1. Add a **Message** node and enter the message **Sounds like you're looking for an account. I can look that up for you.**.

1. Add a **Question** node and enter the message **What's the name of the customer you're looking for?**.

1. For **Identify**, select **Organization**.

    **User's entire response** will also work. However, selecting the **Organization** entity takes advantage of the bot's language understanding capabilities to extract the organization name from the response.

1. For **Save response as**, rename the variable to **organization**.

## Create a flow

1. On the authoring canvas, select **Add node** (**+**). Select **Call an action**, and then select **Create a flow**.

1. In the Power Automate portal, name the flow **Search Account**.

1. Add a **Text** input named **Organization**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/advanced-flow-set-of-results/text-input.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the flow trigger with a text input added.":::

1. Select **Insert a new step** (**+**) and select **Add an action**.

1. Select the **Microsoft Dataverse** connector, and then select the **Search rows** action.

    This action uses fuzzy matching to find relevant accounts in your [Dataverse Account table](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/entity-overview).

    :::image type="content" source="media/advanced-flow-set-of-results/dataverse-connector.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Dataverse connector Search rows action.":::

1. For **Search term**, select the **Organization** variable.

1. Select **Show advanced options** and set the following items as given:
    - **Table filter Item**: `account`
    - **Sort by Item - 1**: `@search.score desc`
    - **Sort by Item - 2**: `name asc`

## Format results

The **Search rows** action returns the **List of rows** variable, which contains JSON data. Before you can use the data, you'll need to analyze it with the **Parse JSON** action.

1. Select **Insert a new step** (**+**) and select **Add an action**.

1. Select the **Data Operation** connector, and then select the **Parse JSON** action.

1. In the **Content** box, under **Search rows**, select the **List of rows** variable.

1. Copy the following JSON schema and paste it in the **Schema** box:

    ```json
    {
        "type": "array",
        "items": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "@@search.score": {
                    "type": "number"
                },
                "name": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "address1_city": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "accountnumber": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            },
            "required": [
                "name"
            ]
        }
    }
    ```

   ```powerappsfl
   - @{items('Apply_to_each')['accountnumber']}: @{items('Apply_to_each')['name']} - @{items('Apply_to_each')['address1_city']}
   ```

1. Add a line break after the snippet to make each result appear on its own line.
