# Use a custom data source for generative answers

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

In some cases, your data might not exist in a supported data source. However, you can provide your own data through Power Automate cloud flows or through HTTP requests. You then format the results into a JSON object as a `Table` variable or expression to generate answers.

The custom data field takes a `Table` as an input, with the below properties:

| Name   | Required | Description |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| `Content` | True | Source content that is used to be summarized and answer the input question. |
| `ContentLocation` |   | Optional URL for the citation of the source content |
| `Title` |   | Optional title for the citation of the source content |

Here's a sample table:

```powerapps-dot
[
 {
  Content: "This is a sample piece of text that was provided for testing purposes, to be replaced with content of your choice",
  ContentLocation: "https://contoso.com/p1.htm",
  Title: "Contoso Sample"
 },
 {
  Content: "This is a second bit of sample text that can be replaced with content of your choice",
  ContentLocation: "https://fabrikam.com/p2.htm"
 },
 {
  Content: "This is a third bit of sample text that can be replaced with content of your choice",
  Title: "Adventure Works Cycles Sample"
 },
 {
  Content: "This is a fourth bit of sample text that can be replaced with content of your choice"
 }
]
```

Copilot answers are generated from `Content` and include the link to the data source in `ContentLocation`. If a `Title`, is it used for the citation.


## Use custom data

1. Open the **Data source** configuration pane from one of two places:

   1. On the **Create generative answers** node, select **Edit** under **Data sources**.

      :::image type="content" source="media/nlu-gpt/select-properties-from gen-ans.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to select the Properties pane.":::

   1. Alternatively, select the `...` in the **Create generative answers** node, then select **Properties** to open a pane, and finally select **Data source**.

1. In the **Custom data** field, enter the JSON array you want to use or the variable for the array.

1. Select **Save** to save any changes to your topic.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Information sources defined in the **Generative answers** node take priority at the copilot level. Copilot level sources function as a fallback.
