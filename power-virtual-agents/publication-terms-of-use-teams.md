# Create a privacy statement and terms of use in Microsoft Teams

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

When you want to publish your bot so other Microsoft Teams users can access it, you need to provide the following information about your bot:

- A link to a compliant privacy statement
- A link to the terms of use (TOU) for the bot
- A link to the developer's website for more information
- The developer's name

You should update each of these with your own information. See the Microsoft Teams documentation about [Privacy policy, terms of use, and support URLs](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/submission-checklist#privacy-policy-terms-of-use-and-support-urls) for some more ideas on what to include.

The following table lists the default values that are provided in a Microsoft Copilot Studio chatbot, and suggestions on what you should enter instead:

Requirement | Default value | Suggestions
-|-|-
Privacy statement | [Empty privacy statement and terms of use](#empty-privacy-statement-and-terms-of-use) | You should work with your manager or IT department to determine what you want to say in your privacy statement. This should follow your organization's privacy practices.
Terms of use | [Empty privacy statement and terms of use](#empty-privacy-statement-and-terms-of-use) | Work with your manager or IT department to define the terms of use. Typically this would include any limitations you might have on how the information can be used. See [Teams privacy policy guidelines](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/submission-checklist#privacy-policy).
Developer website | Link to the [Microsoft Copilot Studio overview page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2138949) | You could include a link to your Office profile, or a SharePoint site for your team.
Developer's name | _Powered by Microsoft Copilot Studio_ | You should include a name of someone who can be contacted in case someone has questions about the bot.

## Empty privacy statement and terms of use

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This app is not developed by Microsoft. If you are a user of a bot and see this page, it means the bot developer did not provide a terms of use and privacy statement for the bot.  
>
> For privacy policy or terms of use, contact the developer of this app.

If you do not enter links to a privacy statement or terms of use, then chatbot users are redirected here.
