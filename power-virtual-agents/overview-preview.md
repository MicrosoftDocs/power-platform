# Overview

Power Virtual Agents is evolving. The new intelligent bot authoring experience unifies the sophistication of Azure Bot Framework Composer's "pro-code" capabilities with the simplicity of the Power Virtual Agents low-code platform. It's even easier for professional developers and subject matter experts to build collaboratively in one Microsoft bot-building studio.

This evolution brings several exciting new features:

- A new authoring experience

  - [Use GPT-based capabilities to expand your bot's reach](nlu-gpt-overview.md)
  - [Add images, videos, and cards to a message](authoring-send-message.md)
  - [Message variations](authoring-send-message.md#use-message-variations)
  - [Quick replies](authoring-send-message.md#use-quick-replies)
  - [Speech authoring](authoring-send-message.md#use-ssml-to-customize-speech-responses)
  - [YAML code editor](authoring-create-edit-topics.md)

- Power FX and variable management
  - [Enhanced variable management](authoring-variables.md)
  - [Power Fx support](advanced-power-fx.md)

Check out the [Quickstart](quickstart-preview.md) for a guided tutorial on how to use the new features.

The Power Virtual Agents preview doesn't yet support some of the features you're used to in Power Virtual Agents, such as agent transfers and bot authoring in Teams.
