# Delete your bot

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

If you want to remove your bot from the Power Virtual Agents environment, you can delete it using the **Delete Bot** command on the **Settings** menu.

## To delete a bot

1. Select **Settings** on the Power Virtual Agents title bar, and then select **General settings** to display the **General** pane of the **Settings** window.

2. In the **Delete bot** section, select **Delete bot**.


Power Virtual Agents removes your bot from the system and opens the **Create a new bot** screen, giving you the opportunity to create a new bot.

For information about creating a bot, see [Creating a bot](getting-started-create-bot.md).
