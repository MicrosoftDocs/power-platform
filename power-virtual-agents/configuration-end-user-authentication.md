# Configure user authentication in Microsoft Copilot Studio

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

Authentication allows users to sign in, giving your bot access to a restricted resource or information. Users can sign in with [Microsoft Entra ID](configuration-authentication-azure-ad.md), or with any [OAuth2 identity provider](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow) such as Google or Facebook.


>[!NOTE]
> In Microsoft Teams, you can configure a Microsoft Copilot Studio bot to provide authentication capabilities, so that users can sign in with a Microsoft Entra ID or any [OAuth2 identity provider](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow), such as a Microsoft or Facebook account. 

You can [add user authentication to your bot](advanced-end-user-authentication.md) when you edit a topic.

Microsoft Copilot Studio supports the following authentication providers:

- Azure Active Directory v1
- Microsoft Entra ID
- Any identity provider that complies with the [OAuth2 standard](/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Changes to the authentication configuration will only take effect after you publish your bot. Make sure to plan ahead before you make authentication changes to your bot.

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Microsoft Copilot Studio](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).

## Choose an authentication option

Microsoft Copilot Studio supports several authentication options. Choose the one that meets your needs.

To change your bot's authentication settings, in the navigation menu under **Settings**, go to the **Security** tab and select the **Authentication** card.

:::image type="content" source="media/configuration-end-user-authentication/auth-manage-sm.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Security page under the Settings menu, highlighting the Authentication card.":::

The following authentication options are available:

- No authentication
- Only for Teams and Power Apps
- Manual (for any channel including Teams)

### No Authentication

No authentication means your bot won't require your users to sign in when interacting with bot. An unauthenticated configuration means your copilot or bot can only access public information and resources.

[!INCLUDE[no-auth-warning-note](includes/blocks/no-auth-warning.md)]

### Only for Teams and Power Apps

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When the **Only for Teams and Power Apps** option is selected, all channels except the Teams channel will be disabled.
>
> Additionally, the **Only for Teams and Power Apps** option is not available if your bot is integrated with [Dynamics 365 Customer Service](configuration-hand-off-omnichannel.md).

Teams and Power Apps authentication is enabled by default for bots and copilots that you create in Microsoft Copilot Studio. 

This configuration automatically sets up Microsoft Entra ID authentication for Teams without the need for any manual configuration. Since Teams authentication itself identifies the user, users aren't prompted to sign in while they're in Teams, unless your bot needs expanded scope.

Only the Teams channel is available if you select this option. If you need other channels but still want authentication for your bot (such as when [using generative AI features](nlu-gpt-overview.md), choose **Manual** authentication.

If you select the **Only for Teams and Power Apps** option, the following variables are available in the authoring canvas:

- `UserID`
- `UserDisplayName`

For more information about these variables and how to use them, see [Add user authentication to a Microsoft Copilot Studio bot](advanced-end-user-authentication.md#authentication-variables).

`AuthToken` and `IsLoggedIn` variables aren't available with this option. If you need an authentication token, use the **Manual** option.

If you change from **Manual** to **Only for Teams and Power Apps** authentication, and your topics contain the variables `AuthToken` or `IsLoggedIn`, they're displayed as **Unknown** variables after the change. Make sure to correct any topics with errors before you publish your bot.

### Manual (for any channel including Teams)

You can configure any Microsoft Entra ID v1, Microsoft Entra ID, or OAuth2-compatible identity provider with this option. The following variables are available in the authoring canvas after you configure manual authentication:

- `UserID`
- `UserDisplayName`
- `AuthToken`
- `IsLoggedIn`

For more information about these variables and how to use them, see [Add user authentication to a Microsoft Copilot Studio bot](advanced-end-user-authentication.md#authentication-variables).

Once the configuration is saved, make sure to publish your bot so the changes take effect.

> [!NOTE]
> Authentication changes only take effect after the bot is published.

## Required user sign in and bot sharing

**Require users to sign in** determines whether a user needs to sign in before talking with the bot. We highly recommended that you turn on this setting when your bot needs to access sensitive or restricted information.

:::image type="content" source="media/configuration-end-user-authentication/auth-require-user-to-sign-in.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Authentication pane showing the Require user to sign in option.":::

This option is not available when the **No authentication** option is chosen.

If you turn off this option, your bot won't ask users to sign in until it encounters a topic that requires them to.

When you turn on this option, it creates a system topic called **Require users to sign in**. This topic is only relevant for the **Manual** authentication setting. Users are always authenticated on Teams.

The **Require users to sign in** topic is automatically triggered for any user who talks to the bot without being authenticated. If the user fails to sign in, the topic redirects to the **Escalate** system topic.

The topic is read-only and can't be customized. To see it, select **Go to the authoring canvas**.

### Control who can chat with the bot in the organization

Your bot's authentication and **Require user to sign in** setting in combination determines whether you can [share the bot](admin-share-bots.md) to control who in your organization can chat with it. The authentication setting doesn't affect sharing a bot for collaboration.

- **No authentication**: Any user who has a link to the bot (or can find it; for example, on your website) can chat with it. You can't control which users in your organization can chat with the bot.

- **Only for Teams**: The bot works only on [the Teams channel](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams.md). Since the user will always be signed in, the **Require users to sign in** setting is turned on and can't be turned off. You can use bot sharing to control who in your organization can chat with the bot.

- **Manual (for any channel including Teams)**:
  
  - If the service provider is either **Azure Active Directory** or **Microsoft Entra ID**, you can turn on **Require users to sign in** to control who in your organization can chat with the bot using bot sharing.
  
  - If the service provider is **Generic OAuth2**, you can turn **Require users to sign in** on or off. When it's turned on, a user who signs in can chat with the bot. You can't control which specific users in your organization may chat with the bot using bot sharing.

When a bot's authentication setting can't control who can chat with it, if you select **Share** on the bot's overview page a message informs you that anyone can chat with your bot.

## Manual authentication fields

<sup>1</sup> You can use spaces in the **Scopes** field if the identity provider requires it. In that case, enter a comma (`,`) in **Scope list delimiter**, and enter spaces in the **Scopes** field.

## Remove the authentication configuration

1. In the navigation menu, under **Settings**, select **Security**. Then select the **Authentication** card.
1. Select **No authentication**.
1. Publish the bot.

If authentication variables are being used in a topic, they'll become **Unknown** variables. Go to the Topics page to see which topics have errors and fix them before publishing.
