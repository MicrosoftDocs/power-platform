# Configure hand-off to Dynamics 365 Customer Service

When your customers need to speak with a human agent, your bot can seamlessly hand off the conversation. With the omnichannel capabilities of the [Chat Add-in for Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/omnichannel/omnichannel-customer-service-guide), you can connect both voice and text conversations.

When your bot hands off a conversation, it shares the full history of the conversation and all variables collected in the interaction. Your omnichannel service routes incoming escalations to the right queue, and a live agent can seamlessly resume the conversation. For more information about how to use hand-off in bot conversations, see [Hand off to a live agent](./advanced-hand-off.md).

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Power Virtual Agents](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).
- Sign in with an account that has the [omnichannel administrator role](/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/add-users-assign-roles#understand-roles-and-their-privileges).
- Have a [product license for Power Virtual Agents](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2092080&clcid=0x409) and a [product license for the Chat Add-in for Dynamics 365 Customer service](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/omnichannel/try-chat-for-dynamics365).
- Environments:
  - Your bot environment and omnichannel environment must be in the same [geographical region](./data-location.md#data-locations).
  - To use [voice capabilities](#voice-based-capabilities), your tenant and environment must be in the [United States, Europe, Asia, or Australia geographies](./data-location.md#data-locations).
- [Register an application with Azure AD](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#create-an-azure-active-directory-application).
- For end-to-end capabilities to work as expected, your bot must be [published](./publication-fundamentals-publish-channels.md).

## Connect your bot to Omnichannel for Customer Service

> [!NOTE]
> If you connected your bot to omnichannel engagement before November 2021, the settings on the **Omnichannel** tile will look as if they haven't been configured. This is a known issue. It doesn't affect the bot or the omnichannel connection, which will continue to run normally. Select **Enable** to refresh the settings and show the actual connection details.

1. In Power Virtual Agents, edit your bot. In the left panel, select **Manage**, **Agent transfers**, and then select the **Omnichannel** tile.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/handoff-settings.png" alt-text="The bot management Agent transfers page.":::

1. Select **Enable**.

    - If the [required extensions](#recommended-extensions) aren't installed, you'll see a message that your bot doesn't have access to the variables or actions it needs.

        :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/handoff-no-extension.png" alt-text="Message at the top of the Omnichannel configuration pane that says your bot doesn't have access.":::

    - If you're using Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), you may see a message that we can't determine if omnichannel integration is enabled for the environment. For more information, see [Bots with ALM](#bots-with-alm).

1. Under **See the environment this bot is connected to**, select the environment where you have omnichannel integration turned on. If you haven't set up Omnichannel for Customer Service in that environment, you'll see a message inviting you to begin a trial.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/transfer-no-oc.png" alt-text="Message that says you haven't set up Omnichannel integration in this environment.":::

1. Select **See how to register a new Application ID** and follow the steps to find or create the app registration for Power Virtual Agents.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/handoff-bot-appid.png" alt-text="The Omnichannel configuration pane, with the Application ID section highlighted.":::

1. On the Azure portal go to **App registrations**, then select **Overview**. Copy the **Application (client) ID** .

1. Return to the **Omnichannel** pane in Power Virtual Agents and paste the Application ID in the **Application ID** box.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Omnichannel for Customer Service models bots as "application users." Therefore, the Application ID that you use must be unique to your Microsoft Dataverse organization or environment.

1. Select **Add your bot**.

   Power Virtual Agents uses a [Teams channel](./publication-fundamentals-publish-channels.md) to communicate with Omnichannel for Customer Service. If one isn't turned on, a Teams channel will be enabled when you select **Add your bot**.

1. Select the **View details in Omnichannel** link to [continue configuring the bot connection in your omnichannel interface](/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/configure-bot-virtual-agent).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To test the bot on your custom website, you must use the embed code that's specified in the chat widget you set up in Omnichannel for Customer Service. If you use the embed code from Power Virtual Agents, hand-off won't work. For more information, see [Embed chat widget in your website or portal](/dynamics365/customer-service/embed-chat-widget-portal).

To add [voice capabilities](#voice-based-capabilities) after you've connected your bot to Omnichannel, you must disconnect the bot from your omnichannel service and reconnect it.

### Bots with ALM

If you've [set up ALM for your bots](/power-platform/alm/basics-alm), and are exporting and importing bots between [development (unmanaged) and test or production (managed) environments](/power-platform/alm/basics-alm#types-of-environments-used-in-alm), you might see a message that we can't determine if omnichannel integration is enabled for the environment.

:::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/transfer-managed-bot.png" alt-text="Message that we can't determine if this bot has Omnichannel enabled or disabled.":::

If the bot you exported has omnichannel capabilities enabled, you can ignore this message. The bot will still work properly. The message will disappear after you export the latest version of your bot from your development environment, and then import it into a targeted test or production environment with managed bots.

If you continue to see the message after exporting and importing the latest version of your managed bot, make sure to remove any unmanaged layers:
  
1. Sign in to Power Apps and select the managed bot's environment.  

1. In the left pane, select **Solutions**, and then select the solution that contains the bot with the unmanaged layer.  

1. Next to the chatbot component in the solution, select **More commands** (**â€¦**), and then select **See solution layers**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/handoff-see-layers.png" alt-text="Selecting solution layers in Power Apps.":::

1. Select the unmanaged layer, and then select **Remove unmanaged layer**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/handoff-remove-layer.png" alt-text="Remove unmanaged layer in Power Apps.":::

If your bot doesn't have omnichannel capabilities enabled, the message will always show.

## Manage your bot's omnichannel capabilities

Select **Manage**, **Agent transfers**, and then select the **Omnichannel** tile. Here you can disconnect or disable your bot, refresh the connection, or open the Omnichannel admin center to view the connection details.

### Disconnect your bot from omnichannel or disable the omnichannel connection

If you select **Disconnect bot**, the application user that represents the bot in your omnichannel instance is disabled. This effectively disconnects the bot from the omnichannel environment.

To add your bot back, you'll need to [connect it again](#connect-your-bot-to-omnichannel-for-customer-service), starting at Step 3.

If you select **Disable**, the connection between your omnichannel instance and Power Virtual Agents is disabled. Your bot will stop receiving any traffic from your omnichannel instance.

### Refresh the connection

If you select **Refresh**, the connection between your bot and the omnichannel instance is tested and verified.  

It's a good idea to refresh the connection after you add your bot to an omnichannel workstream to make sure that the connection was successful.

## Voice-based capabilities

The [Power Virtual Agents telephony extension](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-crm/mscrm.mspva_telephony_extension) adds several actions and variables to Power Virtual Agents.

Select **Enable voice** to turn voice capabilities on or off for the entire bot, not for individual bot sessions or connections. When voice is enabled, any connection with the bot can use voice, text, or both voice and text.

### bot.CustomerPhoneNumber

This variable contains the customer's phone number. It's also known as CallerID.

You can use the "Is Empty" condition with `bot.CustomerPhoneNumber` to find out the customer's communication channel. If the conversation is from a call, "Is Empty" always returns _False_. If it's from messaging, "Is Empty" always returns _True_.

### bot.OrganizationPhoneNumber

This variable contains the phone number the customer dialed.

### Dynamics 365 variables

Dynamics 365 Customer Service provides [more context variables](/dynamics365/customer-service/context-variables-for-bot#context-variables-for-power-virtual-agents-bots) for Power Virtual Agents bots.

### Authoring considerations

Authentication isn't supported for voice-based hand-off to omnichannel instances. If you've set up authentication for your bot, the [authentication variables](./advanced-end-user-authentication.md) don't include authentication information when they're sent to your omnichannel instance.

> [!WARNING]
> For voice-based hand-off capabilities to work, both your bot and omnichannel environments must be hosted in a datacenter in the [United States, Europe, Asia, or Australia geographies](data-location.md#data-locations). Otherwise, voice capabilities don't work, and you won't receive any error messages or warnings.

If your bot incorporates adaptive cards, make sure you use [Bot Framework Composer](./advanced-bot-framework-composer.md) so that the voice bot correctly reads their "speak" property.

If your topics include Markdown content, the voice bot will read the asterisk (*). Adjust your Markdown content accordingly, and always test your bot using voice to make sure you get the desired result.

## Known limitations

See [limitations when using Power Virtual Agents with the Chat Add-in for Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/configure-bot-virtual-agent#limitations).

## Recommended extensions

The following extensions are not required to hand-off to Omnichannel, but they provide bot authors with a better experience by providing [additional variables and actions](#voice-based-capabilities).

Typically, the extensions are automatically installed in your omnichannel environment. However, if the environment that you connected omnichannel to is not the same environment your bot is in, you'll need to manually install the extensions.

### For both text and voice hand-off

Install the following extensions in this order:

  1. [Power Virtual Agents telephony extension](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-crm/mscrm.mspva_telephony_extension)
  1. [Omnichannel Power Virtual Agent extension](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.omnichannelpvaextension)
  1. [Omnichannel Voice Power Virtual Agent extension](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.omnichannelvoicepvaextension)

### For only text (messaging) hand-off

Install [Omnichannel Power Virtual Agent extension](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.omnichannelpvaextension).

If you still see the following warning after installing the Omnichannel Power Virtual Agent extension, and you don't need voice capabilities, you can safely ignore it.
