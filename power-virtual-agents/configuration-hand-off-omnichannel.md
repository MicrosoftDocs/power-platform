# Configure hand-off to Dynamics 365 Customer Service

When your customers need to speak with a human agent, your bot can seamlessly hand off the conversation. With the omnichannel capabilities of the [Chat Add-in for Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/omnichannel/omnichannel-customer-service-guide), you can connect both voice (Classic only, coming soon for all other bots) and text (messaging) conversations.

> [!NOTE]
> Connecting to Dynamics 365 Customer Service Omnichannel for **voice** capabilities is available to Power Virtual Agents Classic only at this moment. This feature is coming soon to all other bots.

When your bot hands off a conversation, it shares the full history of the conversation and all variables collected in the interaction. Your Omnichannel for Customer Service routes incoming escalations to the right queue, and a live agent can seamlessly resume the conversation. For more information about how to use hand-off in bot conversations, see [Hand off to a live agent](./advanced-hand-off.md).

You can also enable single sign-on (SSO) to allow chatbots to sign users in if they're logged in to the page where the bot is deployed. For more information, see [Configure single sign-on](configure-sso.md) and [Pass authentication token to bot during single sign-on in live chat](/dynamics365/customer-service/pass-auth-token-sso-live-chat).

# [Web app](#tab/webApp)

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Power Virtual Agents](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).
- Sign in with an account that has at least OC_Admin and Bot Author roles.
- Have a [product license for Power Virtual Agents](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=2092080&clcid=0x409) and a [product license for the Chat Add-in for Dynamics 365 Customer service](/dynamics365/customer-engagement/omnichannel/try-chat-for-dynamics365).
- Your bot and Omnichannel for Customer Service must be in the same environment.
- For end-to-end capabilities to work as expected, you must [publish](./publication-fundamentals-publish-channels.md) your bot.

> [!WARNING]
> Power Virtual Agents bots with names that are longer than 30 characters will fail to connect when you follow the instructions in this topic. Ensure your bot's name contains less than 30 characters before you proceed.

## Connect your bot to Omnichannel for Customer Service

1. In Power Virtual Agents, edit your bot. In the navigation menu, select **Settings**, **Agent transfers**, and then select the **Omnichannel** tile.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/PVA2-handoff-settings.png" alt-text="The bot management Agent transfers page.":::

1. Select **Connect**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/PVA2-handoff-connect.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the connect pane for OmniChannel transfer to agent":::

    - Note that the OmniChannel installation must be in the same environment as the bot.
    - If you're using Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), you may see a message that we can't determine if Omnichannel for Customer Service integration is enabled for the environment. For more information, see [Bots with ALM](#bots-with-alm).

1. Select the **View  in Omnichannel** link to [continue configuring the bot connection in Omnichannel for Customer Service](/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/configure-bot-virtual-agent).

### Bots with Application Lifecycle Management

Suppose you've [set up Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) for your bots](/power-platform/alm/basics-alm), and are exporting and importing bots between [development (unmanaged) and test or production (managed) environments](/power-platform/alm/basics-alm#types-of-environments-used-in-alm). In that case, you might see a message that we can't determine if Omnichannel for Customer Service integration is enabled for the environment.

:::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/transfer-managed-bot.png" alt-text="Message that we can't determine if this bot has omnichannel capabilities enabled or disabled.":::

If the bot you exported has omnichannel capabilities enabled, you can ignore this message. The bot will still work properly. The message will disappear after you export the latest version of your bot from your development environment and then import it into a targeted test or production environment with managed bots.

If you continue to see the message after you export and import the latest version of your managed bot, make sure to remove any unmanaged layers:

1. Sign in to Power Apps and select the managed bot's environment.  

1. In the navigation menu, select **Solutions**, and then select the solution that contains the bot with the unmanaged layer.

1. Next to the chatbot component in the solution, select **More commands** (**&vellip;**), and then select **See solution layers**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/handoff-see-layers.png" alt-text="Selecting solution layers in Power Apps.":::

1. Select the unmanaged layer, and then select **Remove unmanaged layer**.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/handoff-remove-layer.png" alt-text="Remove unmanaged layer in Power Apps.":::

If your bot doesn't have omnichannel capabilities enabled, the message will always show.

## Configure inactivity timeout to close conversation

Dynamics 365 Customer Service expects a conversation to end after a period of inactivity. This feature is important to ensure the supervisor view displays the correct ongoing conversations and manages agent loads and metrics correctly. When you create a bot from Dynamics 365 Customer Service, the default bot content includes two topics: **Session Timeout Reminder** and **Session Timeout**. These topics use the [Inactivity trigger](authoring-triggers.md?tabs=preview#inactivity) to first remind the user, and then close the conversation after a set inactivity timeout value, which can be configured in the topic. But if you create the bot from the Power Virtual Agents portal, those topics aren't included in the bot. To create them, follow the steps below:

### Create a Session Timeout topic

1. From the left navigation, select **Topics**.

1. From the top bar, select **New topic** and **From blank**.

1. Hover the trigger **Phrases** and select the **Change trigger** icon.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/PVA2-Change-Trigger.png" alt-text="Change topic's trigger":::
    
1. Select **Inactivity** from the list.

1. Select **Edit** in the trigger node to configure the inactivity duration.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/PVA2-Inactivity-Trigger.png" alt-text="Configure inactivity trigger":::

1. Select a **Value** from the dropdown, or enter an arbitrary value (in seconds) using a **Formula** entry. This value is the amount of inactive time it takes for the topic to trigger.

1. Select which channel it applies to by using the **Condition** option. For OmniChannel, click on **Select a variable** under the **Condition** block, select the **System** tab, and **Activity.Channel**. 

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/PVA2-Inactivity-Condition.png" alt-text="Change inactivity trigger condition":::

1. Select **Omnichannel** from the dropdown.

1. Finally, add a message, and at the end, add an End Conversation node so the conversation ends. Click on the **(+)** sign, select **Topic management**, and then select **End conversation**.

Finally, save and publish your bot.

## Manage your bot's omnichannel capabilities

Select **Settings**, **Agent transfers**, and then select the **Omnichannel** tile. Here you can disconnect your bot and find the link to go to the Omnichannel for Customer Service admin center to view the connection details.

### Disconnect your bot from Omnichannel for Customer Service or disable the connection

If you select **Disconnect**, the application user that represents the bot in your Omnichannel for Customer Service instance is disabled. Your bot effectively disconnects from the Omnichannel for Customer Service environment and stops receiving any traffic from your Omnichannel for Customer Service instance.

:::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/PVA2-handoff-disconnect.png" alt-text="Screenshot of OmniChannel pane with a disconnect button.":::

To add your bot back, you need to [connect it again](#connect-your-bot-to-omnichannel-for-customer-service), starting at Step 2.

## Known limitations

See [limitations when using Power Virtual Agents with the Chat Add-in for Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/configure-bot-virtual-agent#limitations).

## Connect your bot to Omnichannel for Customer Service

> [!NOTE]
> If you connected your bot to Omnichannel for Customer Service engagement before November 2021, the settings on the **Omnichannel** tile will look as if they haven't been configured. This is a known issue. It doesn't affect the bot or its omnichannel capabilities, which will continue to run normally. Select **Enable** to refresh the settings and show the actual connection details.

1. In Power Virtual Agents, edit your bot. In the navigation menu, select **Settings**, **Agent transfers**, and then select the **Omnichannel** tile.

    :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/handoff-settings.png" alt-text="The bot management Agent transfers page.":::

1. Select **Enable**.

    - If the [required extensions](#recommended-extensions) aren't installed, you'll see a message that your bot doesn't have access to the variables, or actions it needs.

      :::image type="content" source="./media/configuration-hand-off-omnichannel/handoff-no-extension.png" alt-text="Message at the top of the Omnichannel configuration pane that says your bot doesn't have access.":::

    - If you're using Application Lifecycle Management (ALM), you may see a message that we can't determine if Omnichannel for Customer Service integration is enabled for the environment. For more information, see [Bots with ALM](#bots-with-alm).

1. Under **See the environment this bot is connected to**, select the environment where you have Omnichannel for Customer Service integration turned on. If your bot and Omnichannel for Customer Service are in different environments, Analytics for Omnichannel for Customer Service won't work for your bot.

    If you haven't set up Omnichannel for Customer Service in that environment, you'll see a message that invites you to begin a trial.

## Manage your bot's omnichannel capabilities

Select **Settings**, **Agent transfers**, and then select the **Omnichannel** tile. Here you can disconnect or disable your bot, refresh the connection, or open the Omnichannel for Customer Service admin center to view the connection details.

### Disconnect your bot from Omnichannel for Customer Service or disable the connection

If you select **Disconnect bot**, the application user that represents the bot in your Omnichannel for Customer Service instance is disabled. Your bot is effectively disconnected from the Omnichannel for Customer Service environment.

To add your bot back, you need to [connect it again](#connect-your-bot-to-omnichannel-for-customer-service), starting at Step 3.

If you select **Disable**, the connection between your Omnichannel for Customer Service instance and Power Virtual Agents is disabled. Your bot stops receiving any traffic from your Omnichannel for Customer Service instance.

### Refresh the connection

If you select **Refresh**, the connection between your bot and the Omnichannel for Customer Service instance is tested and verified.

It's a good idea to refresh the connection after you add your bot to an Omnichannel for Customer Service workstream to make sure that the connection was successful.

## Voice-based capabilities

The [Power Virtual Agents telephony extension](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-crm/mscrm.mspva_telephony_extension) adds several actions and variables to Power Virtual Agents.

### bot.OrganizationPhoneNumber

This variable contains the phone number the customer dialed.

### Dynamics 365 variables

Dynamics 365 Customer Service provides [more context variables](/dynamics365/customer-service/context-variables-for-bot#context-variables-for-power-virtual-agents-bots) for Power Virtual Agents bots.

### Authoring considerations

Authentication isn't supported for voice-based hand-off to Omnichannel for Customer Service instances. If you've set up authentication for your bot, the [authentication variables](./advanced-end-user-authentication.md) don't include authentication information when they're sent to your Omnichannel for Customer Service instance.

> [!WARNING]
> For voice-based hand-off capabilities to work, both your bot and Omnichannel for Customer Service environments must be hosted in a datacenter in the [United States, Canada, Europe, United Kingdom, Asia, or Australia geographies](data-location.md#data-locations). Otherwise, voice capabilities don't work, and you won't receive any error messages or warnings.

If your bot incorporates adaptive cards, make sure you use [Bot Framework Composer](./advanced-bot-framework-composer.md) so that the voice bot correctly reads their "speak" property.

If your topics include Markdown content, the voice bot reads the asterisk (*). Adjust your Markdown content accordingly, and always test your bot using voice to make sure you get the desired result.

## Known limitations

See [limitations when using Power Virtual Agents with the Chat Add-in for Dynamics 365 Customer Service](/dynamics365/omnichannel/administrator/configure-bot-virtual-agent#limitations).

## Recommended extensions

The following extensions aren't required to hand-off to Omnichannel for Customer Service, but they provide bot authors with a better experience by providing [extra variables and actions](#voice-based-capabilities).

Typically, the extensions are automatically installed in your Omnichannel for Customer Service environment. However, if the environment that you connected Omnichannel for Customer Service to isn't the same environment your bot is in, you need to manually install the extensions.

### Text and voice hand-off

For both text and voice hand-off, install the following extensions in this order:

1. [Power Virtual Agents telephony extension](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-crm/mscrm.mspva_telephony_extension)
1. [Omnichannel Power Virtual Agent extension](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.omnichannelpvaextension)
1. [Omnichannel Voice Power Virtual Agent extension](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.omnichannelvoicepvaextension)

### Text (messaging) hand-off

For only Text (messaging) hand-off, install [Omnichannel Power Virtual Agent extension](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/dynamics-365/mscrm.omnichannelpvaextension).

If you still see the following warning after installing the Omnichannel Power Virtual Agent extension, and you don't need voice capabilities, you can safely ignore it.
