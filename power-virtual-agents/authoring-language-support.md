# Supported languages

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

You can create chatbots in Microsoft Copilot Studio in a number of languages. This means that your bots can reach a much broader audience and engage with more markets all around the world.

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Microsoft Copilot Studio](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).

## Specify a language for your bot

You specify the target language when you first create a bot.

1. In the **Create a new bot** window, select **Language**.

1. Choose the language you want to use.

## Default content in the target language

After your new bot has been created, you'll notice that it already has content in the target language, including system topics and template user topics.

You can now move on to creating new topics for your bot, authoring bot trigger phrases, and creating bot messages in your target language.

When you've created your own topic in the target language, you can test the bot in the chat canvas and see how well it understands user input and responds in that language.

## List of supported languages

Microsoft Copilot Studio supports languages in three stages. The stage indicates how well the bot can understand user input in that language, with general availability being the strongest, followed by preview, and then experimental.
