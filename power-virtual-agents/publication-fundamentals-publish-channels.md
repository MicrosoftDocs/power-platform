# Key concepts - Publish your bot

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
>
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](publication-fundamentals-publish-channels.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](teams/publication-fundamentals-publish-channels-teams.md)

With Power Virtual Agents, you can publish bots to engage with your customers on multiple platforms or channels. These include live websites, mobile apps, and messaging platforms like Microsoft Teams and Facebook.

After you've published at least once, you can connect your bot to more channels.

Each time you want to update your bot, you publish it again from within the Power Virtual Agents app itself. Publishing your bot will update the bot across all the channels where you've inserted or connected your bot.

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Power Virtual Agents](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).

## Publish the latest bot content

You need to publish the bot at least once before your customers can interact with it or before you can share it with your teammates. After the first publish, you can publish the bot again whenever you'd like your customers to engage with the latest bot content.

1. On the left side pane, select the **Publish** tab.

1. Select **Publish** to make the latest bot content available to your customers.

    :::image type="content" source="media/publication-fundamentals-publish-channels/channel-publish-latest-content.png" alt-text="Publish latest bot content." border="false":::

    The publishing process will take less than a few minutes as it checks for errors in the latest bot content.

    :::image type="content" source="media/publication-fundamentals-publish-channels/channel-publish-validation.png" alt-text="Validate latest bot content for publish." border="false":::

1. After publishing completes, select the **demo website** link. The link will open a new tab and display a prebuilt demo website where you and your team can interact with the bot. The demo website is useful to gather feedback from stakeholders involved in the bot.

:::image type="content" source="media/publication-fundamentals-publish-channels/channel-go-to-demo-website.png" alt-text="Go to demo website." border="false":::

For details on updating the welcome message and help text on the demo website, go to [Configure the demo website and add the bot to your live website](publication-connect-bot-to-web-channels.md).

> [!TIP]
> **What's the difference between the test chat and the demo website?**  
> On the demo website, you can share a URL with members of your team, or other stakeholders who want to try out the bot.  However, the website isn't intended for production use, and you shouldn't use it directly with customers.  
> You can use the test chat to see whether conversation flows as expected, and to spot any errors during the bot creation process.

## Configure channels

After publishing your bot at least once, you can add channels to make the bot reachable by your customers.

To configure channels:

1. Select **Manage**.
1. In the left side pane, select the **Channels** tab.

:::image type="content" source="media/publication-fundamentals-publish-channels/channel-channels-menu.png" alt-text="Channel settings." border="false":::

The connection steps are different for each channel. See the related article in the list below more information:

## Channel experience reference table

Different channels have different end-user experiences. The following table shows a high-level overview of the experiences for each channel. Take the channel experiences into account when optimizing your bot content for specific channels.

| Experience                                                                        | Website       | Microsoft Teams                                                                                         | Facebook                                                                                                   | Dynamics Omnichannel for Customer Service                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Users can't send attachments to Power Virtual Agents chatbots. If they try to upload a file (including media, such as images), the bot will say:
>
> *Looks like you tried to send an attachment. Currently, I can only process text. Please try sending your message again without the attachment.*
>
> This applies to all channels, even if the channel or end-user-facing experience supports attachments (for example, if you're using the Direct Line API or Microsoft Teams).
>
> Attachments can be supported if the message is sent to a skill, where the skill bot supports the processing of attachments. For more information, see the [Use Microsoft Bot Framework skills topic](advanced-use-skills.md) for more details on skills.
