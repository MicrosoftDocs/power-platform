# Key concepts - Publish your bot

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

With Microsoft Copilot Studio, you can publish bots to engage with your customers on multiple platforms or channels. These include live websites, mobile apps, and messaging platforms like Microsoft Teams and Facebook.

After you've published at least once, you can connect your bot to more channels.

Each time you want to update your bot, you publish it again from within the Microsoft Copilot Studio app itself. Publishing your bot will update the bot across all the channels where you've inserted or connected your bot.

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Microsoft Copilot Studio](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).


# [Web app](#tab/web)

You need to publish your bot before your customers can engage with it. You can publish your bot on multiple platforms, or "channels".

After you've published your bot to at least one channel, you can connect it to more channels. Remember to publish your bot again after you make any changes to it. 

Publishing your bot updates it across all the channels it's connected to. If you don't, your customers won't be engaging with the latest content.

The bot comes with the **Only for Teams and Power Apps** authentication option turned on. The bot automatically uses Microsoft Entra ID authentication for Teams and Power Apps without requiring any manual setup and only lets you chat with your bot on Teams. 

If you want to allow anyone to chat with your bot, select **No authentication** authentication. 

[!INCLUDE[no-auth-warning-note](includes/blocks/no-auth-warning.md)]

If you want to use other channels and still have authentication for your bot, select **Manual** authentication.

### Publish the latest content

1. With your bot or copilot open for editing, in the navigation menu, select **Publish**.

1. Select **Publish**, and then confirm.

    :::image type="content" source="media/publication-fundamentals-publish-channels/channel-publish-latest-content.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows where to find the Publish button in the bot authoring experience.":::

Publishing can take up to a few minutes.

### Test your bot

Test your bot after it's published. After it's published, you can [make the bot available to users in Microsoft Teams](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams.md) with the installation link or from various places in the Microsoft Teams app store. 

You can share your bot later by selecting **Make bot available to others** from the **Publish** page. 

You can also install the bot for your own use in Microsoft Teams by selecting **Open the bot**.

If you selected the **No authentication** or **Manual** authentication option, select the **Demo website** link to open a prebuilt website in a new browser tab, where you and your teammates can interact with the bot. 

The demo website is also useful to gather feedback from stakeholders before you roll your bot out to customers. Learn how to [configure the demo website and add the bot to your live website](publication-connect-bot-to-web-channels.md).

> [!TIP]
> **What's the difference between the test chat and the demo website?**  
> Use the test chat (the **Test copilot** pane) while you're building your bot to make sure conversation flows as you expect and to spot errors.
>
> Share the demo website URL with members of your team or other stakeholders to try out the bot. The demo website isn't intended for production use. You shouldn't share the URL with customers.

### Configure channels

After publishing your bot at least once, you can add channels to make the bot reachable by your customers.

To configure channels:

1. Select **Settings**.
1. In the navigation menu, select the **Channels** tab.

:::image type="content" source="media/publication-fundamentals-publish-channels/channel-channels-menu.png" alt-text="Channel settings." border="false":::

### Channel experience reference table

Different channels have different end-user experiences. The following table shows a high-level overview of the experiences for each channel. Take the channel experiences into account when optimizing your bot content for specific channels.

> [!TIP]
> To prevent disrupting users who are having an existing conversation with the bot, they will not receive the latest published content until a new conversation has started. A new conversation starts after it has been idle for more than 30 minutes.

> You may want to try out the latest published content in Microsoft Teams right away. You can do so by typing _start over_ in an existing conversation. This will restart the conversation with the latest content you have published.

### Known limitations

- Customer satisfaction survey is a text-only version in Microsoft Teams instead of an adaptive card.
- Microsoft Teams can only render up to six suggested actions for user in one question node.
- A user can't send or upload attachments to the chat. If they try to send an attachment, the bot will reply with _Looks like you tried to send an attachment. Currently, I can only process text. Please try sending your message again without the attachment._
  - This applies to all channels, even if the channel or end-user-facing experience supports attachments (for example, if you're using the Direct Line API or Microsoft Teams).  
  - Attachments can be supported if the message is sent to a skill, where the skill bot supports the processing of attachments.  
  - See the [Use Microsoft Bot Framework skills topic](advanced-use-skills.md) for more details on skills.
