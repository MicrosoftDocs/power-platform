## A note about requests to rectify personal data

If a data subject asks you to rectify their personal data that resides in your organization, you and your organization must determine if it's appropriate to honor the request. Rectifying the data might include taking actions such as editing, redacting, or removing personal data.

You can use Azure AD to manage Copilot Studio users' identities. Enterprise customers can manage personal data rectify requests, including limited editing features, per the nature of a given Microsoft service. As a data processor, Microsoft doesn't offer the ability to correct system-generated logs because these logs reflect factual activities and constitute a historical record of events within Microsoft services.
