Power Virtual Agents empowers customer service teams to easily create powerful bots using a guided, no-code graphical interface without the need for data scientists or developers.
Power Virtual Agents addresses many of the major issues with bot building in the industry today. It eliminates the gap between the subject matter experts and the development teams building the bots, and the long latency between customer support teams recognizing an issue and updating the bot to address it. It removes the complexity of exposing teams to the nuances of conversational AI and the need to write complex code. And, it minimizes the IT effort required to deploy and maintain a custom conversational solution.

Using Power Virtual Agents, you can: 
- **Empower your customer service teams** by allowing them to easily build bots themselves without needing intermediaries, or coding or AI expertise.
- **Reduce costs** by easily automating common support inquiries and freeing human agent time to deal with more complex issues.
- **Improve customer satisfaction** by allowing customers to self-help and resolve issues quickly 24/7 using rich personalized bot conversations.

3. **Enable rich, natural conversations.** Microsoft’s powerful conversational AI capabilities enable your end users to have rich multi-turn conversations that quickly guide them to the right solution. And, unlike most products on the market, there’s no need to retrain AI models. All you need is to provide a few examples of what topic you want the bot to handle and you’re ready to go.

4. **Enable bots to take action.** Bots that can chat with your users are great, but bots that can act on their behalf are even better. With Power Virtual Agents, you can easily integrate with services and backend systems out-of-the-box or through hundreds of easy-to-add custom connectors using Power Automate. This makes it simple to create a bot that not only responds to the user, but also takes action to resolve their issues.

6. **Better together.** Power Virtual Agents works hand-in-hand with [Dynamics 365 for Customer Service Insights](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/customer-service-insights) to provide a holistic view of your customer service operations. You can use Customer Service Insights and Power Virtual Agents together to determine which topics are trending or consuming support resources, and then easily automate them.
