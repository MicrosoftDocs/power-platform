# Example 3 - Use Bing Search as a fallback in Microsoft Copilot Studio

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

[!INCLUDE [Composer integrated with PVA](includes/composer-integrated-with-pva.md)]

Enhance your bot by developing custom dialogs with [Bot Framework Composer](/composer/) and then adding them to your Microsoft Copilot Studio bot.

In this example, you'll learn how to set Bing search as a fallback answer in Microsoft Copilot Studio by using Composer.

[!INCLUDE [Composer License](includes/composer-license.md)]

## Prerequisites

- [Example 1 - Show an Adaptive Card in Microsoft Copilot Studio](advanced-bot-framework-composer-example1.md).
- [Example 2 - Display a multi-select options list in Microsoft Copilot Studio](advanced-bot-framework-composer-example2.md).

## Create a fallback trigger

1. In Microsoft Copilot Studio, open the bot from Example 2. If you haven't completed Example 2 yet, see [Display a multi-select options list in Microsoft Copilot Studio](advanced-bot-framework-composer-example2.md).

1. Open your bot in Composer. For instructions on how to do so, see [Getting started with Bot Framework Composer](advanced-bot-framework-composer-fundamentals.md#open-your-bot-in-composer).

1. In the bot explorer, go to the main dialog. Select **More options** (**...**) then select **Add new trigger**.

1. In the **Create a trigger** window, for **What is the type of this trigger?**, select **Unknown intent**. Select **Submit**.

    ]
