# Error codes: Microsoft Copilot Studio

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

When a bot encounters a problem during a conversation, it will respond with an error message.

If you're a bot user, the error message will contain an error code for the specific problem that was encountered.

If you're a bot maker testing the bot in the [Test bot pane](authoring-test-bot.md), you'll see an additional message that gives more context about the problem.

Errors may also appear in the [Topic Checker](authoring-topic-management.md#topic-errors) where you can easily locate and fix them.

> [!NOTE]
> The following errors can occur in both the web app and Microsoft Teams. To view errors that are exclusive to Teams, please refer to [the Teams version of this topic](error-codes.md).

# [Web app](#tab/webApp)

When a bot encounters a problem during a conversation, it sends an error response.

If you're a bot user, the response contains an error code that identifies the problem. You should give this error code to your administrator.

If you're a bot maker testing the bot in the [Test bot pane](authoring-test-bot.md), the bot's response includes the error code and an error message that gives more context about the problem.

#### ContentError

**Error message:** This error produces dynamic messages based on the context of the error.

**Resolution:** This is a catch-all error for problems related to your bot's content. Refer to the error message for more details.

Common problems include:

- A node is missing required properties.
- Invalid YAML was added with the [code editor](authoring-create-edit-topics.md).
- A [Power Fx formula](advanced-power-fx.md) contains an error.

#### DataLossPreventionViolation

**Error message:** "This environment requires users to sign in before they can use the bot. Go to Manage > Security > Authentication and select the option to require users to sign in."

**Resolution:**

- Your environment's data loss prevention (DLP) policies require that users sign in. See [Configure user authentication](advanced-end-user-authentication.md#add-user-authentication-with-the-signin-system-topic).
- One or more connectors that are used in the bot aren't in the same data group. See [Microsoft Copilot Studio connectors](admin-data-loss-prevention.md#microsoft-copilot-studio-connectors).
- One or more connectors that are used in the bot are blocked by the tenant administrator.

#### FlowActionException

**Error messages:**

- "No output was received from flow {FlowName} ({FlowId}), even though output was expected as per the bot definition."
- "The output parameter with name {ItemKey} on flow {FlowName} ({FlowId}) is missing from the response data. Refresh the flow, or ensure the flow returns this value."
- "The output parameter with name {ItemKey} on flow {FlowName} ({FlowId}) is missing from the output schema. Please refresh the flow."

**Resolution:** [Check the flow for errors](/power-automate/error-checker).

#### FlowActionBadRequest

**Error messages:**

- "The parameter with name {KeyName} on flow {FlowName} ({FlowId}) is declared to be of type {ItemTypeKind}. This type is not supported when invoking Power Automate. Currently, only Text, Boolean and Numbers are supported."
- "The parameter with name {ItemKey} on flow {FlowName} ({FlowId}) is missing in the 'Call Flow' action."
- "The parameter with name {KeyName} on flow {FlowName} ({FlowId}) evaluated to type {ResolveType}, expected type {ExpectedType}."
- "The flow {FlowName} ({FlowId}) failed to run with response code {ResponseCode}, error code: {FlowErrorCode}."

**Resolution:** Check that the [base type](authoring-variables.md#variable-types) of any variables you pass to the flow match the parameter's type.

#### FlowActionTimedOut

**Error message:** "The flow with id {FlowId} has timed out . Error Code: {FlowErrorCode}"

**Resolution:** [Check the flow for errors](/power-automate/error-checker) to understand why the cloud flow took more than 100 seconds to run before it returned to Microsoft Copilot Studio. Try to optimize the query and the data you return from any other backend system. If some of the cloud flow logic can continue to run after a result is sent to the bot, place these actions after the 'Return value(s) to Microsoft Copilot Studio' step in your cloud flow.

#### InvalidContent

**Error message:** "A total of {TotalComponents} component(s) exist in the bot, but none are valid."

**Resolution:** [Open the code editor](authoring-create-edit-topics.md) to review issues with the content.

#### InfiniteLoopInBotContent

**Error message:** "Action {DialogId}.{TriggerId}.{ActionId} was executed more than {MaxTurnCount} times in a row. This indicates a cycle in execution of the dialog and hence dialog execution will be terminated."

**Resolution:** Make sure the topic ends properly and links to other topics that end properly, such as the **Escalate** system topic.

#### LatestPublishedVersionNotFound

**Error message:** "Unable to retrieve the latest published version of the bot."

**Resolution:** [Publish the bot](publication-fundamentals-publish-channels.md).  

#### RedirectToDisabledDialog

**Error message:** "The Dialog with Id {DialogId} is disabled in the definition. Please enable the Dialog before using it."

**Resolution:** [Re-enable the topic](authoring-topic-management.md) or [remove the redirect node](authoring-create-edit-topics.md#delete-a-node).  

#### RedirectToNonExistentDialog

**Error message:** "The Dialog with Id {DialogId} was not found in the definition. Please check that the Dialog is present and that the Id is correct."

**Resolution:** [Create a new topic](authoring-create-edit-topics.md#create-a-topic) to redirect to or [remove the redirect node](authoring-create-edit-topics.md#delete-a-node).

#### SystemError

**Error message:** This error doesn't produce an error message

**Resolution:** [Contact customer support](fundamentals-support.md) for more details.
