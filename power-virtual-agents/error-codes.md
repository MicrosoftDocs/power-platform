# Error codes: Power Virtual Agents

[!INCLUDE[public preview disclaimer](includes/public-preview-disclaimer-prod.md)]

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]

> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](error-codes.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](teams/error-codes-teams.md)

When a bot encounters a problem during a conversation, it will respond with an error message.

If you're a bot user, the error message will contain an error code for the specific problem that was encountered.

If you're a bot maker testing the bot in the [Test bot pane](authoring-test-bot.md), you'll see an additional message that gives more context about the problem.
