# Share your bot with other users

You can share your bots with others to grant them special permissions. There are two different sharing methods:

1. Grant security groups, or your whole organization, permission to chat with the bot.
1. Invite users to collaborate on your bot project. Collaborators always have permission to chat with the bot.

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Power Virtual Agents](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).
- The bot's [end user authentication setting](configuration-end-user-authentication.md) must be configured to **Only for Teams** or **Manual**, with **Azure Active Directory** or **Azure Active Directory V2** as the provider. **Required user sign-in** must be enabled to manage who can chat with the bot in your organization.

# [Web app](#tab/web)

### Share a bot for chat

Bot makers that you've [shared your bot with for collaborative authoring](#share-a-bot-for-collaborative-authoring) will always have permission to chat with the bot. However, you can also grant users permission to chat with the bot without granting them authoring permissions.

To grant users permission to only chat with the bot, you can either:

- Share your bot with a security group.
- Share your bot with everyone in your organization.

### Share bot with security groups

You can share your bot with security groups so their members can chat with the bot.

1. Select **Share** at the top of the bot's overview page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-home.png" alt-text="Sharing UI entry point in bot homepage." border="false":::

1. Specify the security group name that you would like to share the bot with.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When sharing a bot for _chat_, you can only share a bot with security groups. You can't share it with:
    >
    > - Microsoft 365 groups.
    > - Individual users directly. To manage individual user access, add or remove users from the security group.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only share a bot with users who have a Power Virtual Agents per user license. Users who don't have a license can [sign up for a free trial](sign-up-individual.md).

1. To share a bot, sign in to Power Virtual Agents and select **Share** at the top of the bot's overview page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-home.png" alt-text="Power Virtual Agents bot overview page with the Share button highlighted." border="false":::

1. Specify the name or email address of each user that you would like to share the bot with.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > When sharing a bot for _collaborative authoring_, you can only share it with individual users. You can't share it with:
    >
    > - A security group in your organization.
    > - Distribution group in your organization.  
    > - Users or groups outside of your organization.  

    :::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-input-invitee.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing name input in the share window." border="false":::

1. Review the user's permissions.

    :::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-view-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing share window with user permissions." border="false":::

1. If you want to let users know you've shared the bot with them, select the **Send an email invitation to new users** check box.

1. Select **Share** to share the bot with the new users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It can take up to 10 minutes for the bot to show up in the shared user's bot list if the user [was not previously part of the environment](#assign-environment-security-roles) of the shared bot.

### Insufficient environment permissions

Users in the environment must have the **Environment maker** security role before a bot can be shared with them.

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-insufficient-permission.png" alt-text="User does not have sufficient permissions." border="false":::

**System administrators** of the environment need to assign the **Environment maker** security role to the user before you share the bot. If you're a **System administrator**, you can [assign the **Environment maker** role when you share the bot](#assign-environment-security-roles).

Learn more about [security roles](/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges) and [predefined security roles](/power-platform/admin/database-security#predefined-security-roles).

### Share Power Automate flows used in a bot

You can [add actions to a bot using flows in Power Automate](advanced-flow.md); however flows in a bot aren't automatically shared with other users when sharing a bot.

Users who don't have access to the shared flow can still run it by using the test bot canvas.

To let other users edit or add flows you'll need to share them in Power Automate. You can open flows directly from the topic where the flow is used.

1. Select **View flow details** to go to the flow's details page in Power Automate.

    :::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-view-flow-details.png" alt-text="Highlight of the view flow details on a flow in a topic." border="false":::

1. Select **Edit** in the **Owners** section.

    :::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-flow-owners.png" alt-text="Select the Edit link." border="false":::

1. Enter the name or email address of the user you want to give editing permissions to.

### Stop sharing a bot

You can stop sharing a bot with a user, and any shared user can stop the bot from being shared with other users, except for the owner. The owner will always have access to the bot.

1. Sign in to Power Virtual Agents and select **Share** at the top of the bot's overview page.

1. Select **X** next to the users that you want to stop sharing the bot with.

    :::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-remove-user.png" alt-text="Remove bot access 'X'." border="false":::

1. Select **Share** to stop sharing the bot with the user.

## Assign environment security roles

If you're a **System administrator**, you can assign and manage environment security roles when sharing a bot.

The **Environment security roles** section shows when you share a bot and only if you're a **System administrator**. It lets you share bots with users who don't have sufficient environment permissions to use Power Virtual Agents.

You must be a **System administrator** of the environment where the bot is located to view and add security roles.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only _assign_ security roles when sharing a bot. You can't remove security roles when sharing. For full security role management, [use the Power Platform admin center](/power-platform/admin/create-users-assign-online-security-roles#assign-a-security-role-to-a-user).  
>
> Learn more about [security roles](/power-platform/admin/security-roles-privileges) and [predefined security roles](/power-platform/admin/database-security#predefined-security-roles).

### Assign the Environment maker security role during bot sharing

You can assign the **Environment maker** security role when sharing a bot with a user who does not have sufficient environment permissions to run Power Virtual Agents.

When [sharing the bot for chat](#share-a-bot-for-chat), if the specified user does not have sufficient permissions to use Power Virtual Agents in the environment, you'll be notified that the **Environment maker** security role will be assigned to the user so they can use the bot.

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-input-invitee-no-permission.png" alt-text="Share panel with permission notice bubble." border="false":::

### Assign the Bot transcript viewer security role during bot sharing

You can assign the **Bot transcript viewer** security role to users who don't have conversation transcript access when sharing a bot.

Based on the content and target audience of the bot, you may want to give transcript access only to users who have appropriate privacy training.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Conversation transcript access is managed by environment security roles. After assigning the **Bot transcript viewer** security role to a user, that user can access conversation transcripts for all bots that they create or are shared with in the environment.  
>
> In the default environment, every user has the **Bot transcript viewer** role assigned by default. We recommend you create an environment for bots that controls which user can view conversation transcripts. Learn more about how to [Create a new environment for your bots](./environments-first-run-experience.md#create-a-new-environment-for-your-bots)

When [sharing the bot for chat](#share-a-bot-for-chat), you can assign the **Bot transcript viewer** role by selecting the check box.

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-assign-transcript-viewer.png" alt-text="Share panel with Bot transcript viewer role selected." border="false":::

### Manage security roles

You can [manage environment security roles at the Power Platform admin center](/power-platform/admin/database-security#assign-security-roles-to-users-in-an-environment-that-has-a-common-data-service-database).


# [Teams](#tab/teams)

Share your bot with other users so they can chat with the bot or collaborate together to author it.

### Share bots for users to chat with

A user can always chat with a bot if it was created in the same team. You can share bots with users outside of the team with the **Share** options available in Power Virtual Agents.


### Share bot with security groups

You can share your bot with security groups so their members can chat with the bot.

1. Select **Share** at the top of the bot's overview page.

    :::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-bot-homepage-teams.PNG" alt-text="Sharing UI entry point in bot overview page.":::

1. Specify the security group name that you would like to share the bot with.

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can only share a bot with security groups. You cannot share with individual users directly.  
    >
    > You can manage individual user access by adding or removing users from the security group.
    >
    > To make a security-enabled group, please refer to [Microsoft Graph documentation](/graph/api/resources/groups-overview#security-groups-and-mail-enabled-security-groups).

## Share bots to collaborate with others

You can collaborate with others when building chatbots in Microsoft Teams. This means other members of your team can make edits and changes, and you can see who else is editing a topic.

Your permissions are determined by your [Microsoft Teams roles](/microsoftteams/assign-roles-permissions) in the team where your bot is created:

- Team Owners can create, view, edit, and configure all bots in the team where they are Team Owners.
- Team Members can create, edit, and configure bots they have created. They can view other member's bots in the team.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are an owner of an Azure Active Directory group associated with a team, but you are not also a member of that group, you might not see the team in the Power Apps and Power Virtual Agents apps in Microsoft Teams.
>
> You can add yourself as a member to the team and it will resolve the issue after a few minutes.

To share your bot with other users for collaboration, you need to [add them to your team](https://support.microsoft.com/office/add-members-to-a-team-in-teams-aff2249d-b456-4bc3-81e7-52327b6b38e9).

> [!NOTE]
> It could take up to 15 minutes before the new team member sees the team in the Power Virtual Agents app.

You can see a list of the teams you belong to, and each bot within that team by going to the **Chatbots** tab on the top bar. Teams are listed on the left, selecting a team shows the chatbots in that team. Where ever you are in the app, you can always get back to the list of chatbots by selecting **Chatbots** at the top.

> [!TIP]
> **My chatbots** shows all the bots you created and is an easy way for you to find your bot across multiple teams. You can find bots created by other team members by selecting the team.

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/admin-share-bots-list.png" alt-text="The teams and chatbots are listed in the Chatbots tab.":::

You can open bots for editing by selecting the bot's name.

If you select the check mark next to the bot's name, you can go straight to the Topics or Analytics page for that bot. You can also select **Edit** to go to the bot's overview page.

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/admin-share-bots-edit.png" alt-text="The Topics and Analytics buttons appear when a bot is selected.":::

If you select the menu icon next the bot's name you can then select **Edit** to go to the bot's overview page, or go to the Topics or Analytics pages.

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/admin-share-bots-hamburger.png" alt-text="The bot's menu lets you edit details, topics, and see analytics":::

If you rename, restore, or delete a team, it could take up to 2 hours for the changes to be reflected in the Power Virtual Agents app.

---

## Data permissions

To make sure users who chat with your bot can run [Power Automate](advanced-flow.md) flows correctly, you should test your bot to make sure their permissions with the integrated systems are configured correctly.

## Collaborate on bots

After you've shared a bot, everyone can edit the bot's topics.

In the **Topics** list, you can see who's working on a topic under the **Editing** column. You can select the person's icon to quickly chat with them in Teams or send them an email.

This can help prevent conflicts if multiple people are working on the same topic.

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-multi-authors.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing the Power Virtual Agents list of topics with the Currently editing column highlighted.":::

> [!NOTE]
> The list of authors in the **Currently editing** column is only refreshed when the page is loaded.

A list of who's editing the page also appears as user icons on the top of the authoring canvas when you've opened a topic for editing.

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-multi-editing.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a topic being edited with user profile pictures appearing on the top menu bar.":::

If an author does not make any changes to the topic, or disconnects their computer or closes the browser window, they are considered to have abandoned the topic. After 30 minutes of inactivity the user will not be identified as editing the topic.

Occasionally, multiple people might make changes to a topic and attempt to save their changes concurrently. For example, you might open and start editing a topic. Your coworker opens the same topic, makes a small change, and saves it. Then, when you've finished editing the topic, you go to save it, only to find yourself in a conflict state.

Power Virtual Agents will detect this and prevent you from overwriting your coworker by prompting you with an option - you can reload the content with the latest changes (discarding your work), or you can save a copy of the topic (keeping your changes in a new, duplicate copy of the topic).

:::image type="content" source="media/admin-share-bots/sharing-multi-conflict.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing a prompt that says Updated content available and gives you options to discard your changes or save a copy." border="false":::

If you save your changes to a new topic, you can then review your coworker's changes and merge the two topics, deleting the copy of the topic once you've finished.
