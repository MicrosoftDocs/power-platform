# Example 4 - Display a form with a Submit button in Power Virtual Agents

[!INCLUDE [Composer integrated with PVA](includes/composer-integrated-with-pva.md)]

Enhance your bot by developing custom dialogs with [Bot Framework Composer](/composer/) and then adding them to your Power Virtual Agents bot.

In this example, you'll learn how to display a form with a Submit button in Power Virtual Agents by using Composer.

[!INCLUDE [Composer License](includes/composer-license.md)]

## Prerequisites

- [Example 1 - Show an Adaptive Card in Power Virtual Agents](advanced-bot-framework-composer-example1.md).
- [Example 2 - Display a multi-select options list in Power Virtual Agents](advanced-bot-framework-composer-example2.md).
- [Example 3 - Use Bing Search as a fallback in Power Virtual Agents](advanced-bot-framework-composer-example3.md).

## Create a new trigger

1. In Power Virtual Agents, open the bot from Example 3. If you haven't completed Example 3 yet, see [Use Bing Search as a fallback in Power Virtual Agents](advanced-bot-framework-composer-example3.md).

1. Open your bot in Composer. For instructions on how to do so, see [Getting started with Bot Framework Composer](advanced-bot-framework-composer-fundamentals.md#open-your-bot-in-composer).

1. In the bot explorer, go to the main dialog. Select **More options** (**...**) then select **Add new trigger**.

1. In the **Create a trigger** window:

    1. For **What is the type of this trigger?**, select **Intent recognized**.
    1. For **What is the name of this trigger?**, enter `StartTrial`.
    1. For **Trigger phrases**, copy and paste the following:

        ```lu
        - start trial
        - sign up to try
        - register to try service
        ```

    1. Select **Submit**.
