# Key concepts - Authoring Power Virtual Agents bots

When you create bots with Power Virtual Agents, you author and edit topics.

Topics are discrete conversation paths that, when used together within a single bot, allow for users to have a conversation with a bot that feels natural and flows appropriately.

Creating a bot with Power Virtual Agents is easy to do with the [no-code authoring canvas](authoring-create-edit-topics.md), and there are a number of ways you can [manage how topics interact](authoring-topic-management.md), how you want the conversation to flow, and what it should feel like.

It's also easy to [test the bot](authoring-test-bot.md) without having to fully deploy the bot whenever you make a small change.

If you need, use the [lesson topics](authoring-template-topics.md) to help guide you through topic authoring&mdash;from simple to complex scenarios, as well as default [system topics](authoring-system-topics.md).

Finally, you can [choose what language you want your bot to use](authoring-language-support.md) to best fit your needs.

## Prerequisites

- [Learn more about what you can do with Power Virtual Agents](fundamentals-what-is-power-virtual-agents.md).

## Accessibility

The bot authoring canvas is built for accessibility in accordance with [Microsoft Accessibility Guidelines](https://www.microsoft.com/accessibility/), and supports standard navigational patterns. For complex scenarios, users who author content with keyboard navigation can use the following routing anchors.

### Routing anchors

Press enter or space on a route anchor to go into editing mode for that route. Once in the editing mode, you can tab to other node anchors. Once the anchor is selected, you can:

- Press ```Delete``` to delete the route, and make the target node of the route an orphan node if this route is the only route leading to that node.
- Press ```Escape``` to take the user out of tab mode and resume normal tabbing.
- Press ```Enter``` or ```Space``` on a different node to reconnect the route to the new node (same source node, new target node).
- Press ```Tab``` to take you to the next available location to drop this route.

At any time, pressing these hotkeys on a route anchor will read out the properties of the route:

- ```Alt + Shift + A``` will read out the source node.
- ```Alt + Shift + B``` will read out the target node.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using a screen reader, note that the navigation menu entry labeled **Settings** might not get read as "Collapsed", but it is an expandable control which can be selected and expanded. This is a known issue with our menu control which will be fixed at a future date.
