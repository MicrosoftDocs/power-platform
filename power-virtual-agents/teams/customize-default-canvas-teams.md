# Customize the look and feel of the bot's default canvas in Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](../customize-default-canvas.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](customize-default-canvas-teams.md)



You can customize how the bot looks when added as an app in Microsoft Teams. You can change the icon
and the bot name at any time, and add a long and short description when you publish the bot.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Updates to the bot's icon and color may take up to 24 hours to show on bots that are already published and shared.

## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE [Medical and emergency usage](includes/pva-usage-limitations-teams.md)]

## Change the bot avatar icon and name

1. On the side navigation pane, select **Manage** and then **Details**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/custom-canvas-details-teams.png" alt-text="The Details tab is found in the Manage section on the side navigation pane":::

2. Make changes to the **Bot name** and bot avatar icon.  
    The avatar icon needs to be an image type and can be any size - it will be automatically resized and positioned so it is in the middle of the colored square. 
    We recommend you use a 32x32 pixel or 64x64 pixel .png file with transparency, so that way the color will come through the icon.
    
>[!NOTE]
>Setting the bot avatar icon will not show up for bots that are approved by an admin. Bots approved by an admin will use the Teams app icon as the bot avatar. Learn more on [sharing the bot with organization](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams-teams.md#share-the-bot-with-your-organization). 
    


3. When you're finished, select **Save** on the top menu bar.
    
    :::image type="content" source="media/custom-canvas-save-teams.png" alt-text="Save is at the top of the window":::

4. Select **Reset** to revert your changes to the previously saved version.

## Change the bot color and description

When [preparing a bot ready for sharing with other users in your team](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams-teams.md#install-a-bot-as-an-app-in-microsoft-teams), you can also change the bot's icon, color, and short and long descriptions. You can also enter more [information about who built the bot](publication-terms-of-use-teams.md).
