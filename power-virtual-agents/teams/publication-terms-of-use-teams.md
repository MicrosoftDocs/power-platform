# Create a privacy statement and terms of use

When you want to publish your bot so other Microsoft Teams users can access it, you need to provide the following information about your bot:

- A link to a compliant privacy statement
- A link to the terms of use (TOU) for the bot
- A link to the developer's website for more information
- The developer's name

You should update each of these with your own information. See the Microsoft Teams documentation about [Privacy policy, terms of use, and support URLs](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/submission-checklist#privacy-policy-terms-of-use-and-support-urls) for some more ideas on what to include. 

The following table lists the default values that are provided in a Power Virtual Agents chatbot, and suggestions on what you should enter instead:

Requirement | Default value | Suggestions
-|-|-
Privacy statement | [Empty privacy statement and terms of use](#empty-privacy-statement-and-terms-of-use) | You should work with your manager or IT department to determine what you want to say in your privacy statement. This should follow your organization's privacy practices. 
Terms of use | [Empty privacy statement and terms of use](#empty-privacy-statement-and-terms-of-use) | Work with your manager or IT department to define the terms of use. Typically this would include any limitations you might have on how the information can be used. See [Teams privacy policy guidelines](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/appsource/prepare/submission-checklist#privacy-policy).
Developer website | Link to the [Power Virtual Agents overview page](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2138949) | You could include a link to your Office profile, or a SharePoint site for your team.
Developer's name | *Powered by Power Virtual Agents* | You should include a name of someone who can be contacted in case someone has questions about the bot.



## Empty privacy statement and terms of use




>[!IMPORTANT]
>This app is not developed by Microsoft. If you are a user of a bot and see this page, it means the bot developer did not provide a terms of use and privacy statement for the bot.  
>
>For privacy policy or terms of use, contact the developer of this app.

If you do not enter links to a privacy statement or terms of use, then chatbot users are redirected here.
