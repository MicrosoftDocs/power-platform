# Licensing for Power Virtual Agents for Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
>
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](../requirements-licensing.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](requirements-licensing-teams.md)

See the [Licensing for Power Virtual Agents](../requirements-licensing-subscriptions.md) topic for a comparison and description of licenses.

To create and manage Power Virtual Agents chatbots in Teams, you need:

- [A license to use Teams](/MicrosoftTeams/user-access)
- [Licenses to use Power Virtual Agents](../requirements-licensing.md)

In some instances you may see a diamond icon or other indicator when a particular feature requires a different type of license. You'll be prompted about upgrading if you try to use that feature. For example, you'll see diamond icons when publishing to additional channels:
