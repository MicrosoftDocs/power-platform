[!INCLUDE [Preview documentation notice](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer-teams.md)]

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
>
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](../advanced-proactive-message.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](advanced-proactive-message-teams.md)

After you've [published your bot](publication-fundamentals-publish-channels-teams.md) and [made the bot available to end users in Microsoft Teams](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams-teams.md), you can notify users ("recipients") in Microsoft Teams with proactive messages.

See the [Power Virtual Agents web app documentation on proactive messages](../advanced-proactive-message.md) for more information.
