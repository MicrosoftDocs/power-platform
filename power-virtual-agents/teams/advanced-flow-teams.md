# Add actions to a bot using Power Automate in Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
>
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](../advanced-flow.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](advanced-flow-teams.md)

[Power Automate](https://flow.microsoft.com) is a service that you can use to build automated processes using low-code, drag-and-drop tools. By using [cloud flows](/power-automate/overview-cloud) in Power Virtual Agents, you can extend the capabilities of your bot to automate complex activities or query back-end systems.

See the [Power Virtual Agents web app documentation on using Flows](../advanced-flow.md) for more detailed and complex scenarios.
