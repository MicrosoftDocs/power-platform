## Analytics in Power Virtual Agents

The analytics section is divided into a number of pages to give you multiple ways to understand bot performance.

The following terms are used in this section.

- A _conversation_ is an ongoing interaction between a specific user, or group of users, on a channel and your bot. Conversations can pause and resume later, or be transferred to a live agent. The conversation may be one-way, either from the end user to the bot, or from the bot to the end user, but is more commonly a back-and-forth interaction between the end user and the bot.
- _Analytics sessions_ track user engagement for your bot. Analytics sessions try to capture how well your bot handles user tasks.
- _Billed sessions_ are used to measure resource consumption. Billed sessions are independent of analytics sessions.

> [!NOTE]
> Although transcripts are available immediately, the analytics dashboards are updated every hour, so there will be some delay before you see all data.
