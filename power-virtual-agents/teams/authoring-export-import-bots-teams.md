# Export and import chatbots made in Teams


Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](../authoring-export-import-bots.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](authoring-export-import-bots-teams.md)



In Microsoft Teams, you can export and import chatbots between individual teams using the Power Apps Teams app. 

You might want to do this to copy a working chatbot into a new team so you don't have to build it from scratch.

## Export your bot in Teams


Follow the instructions in the section titled **Export customizations from Dataverse for Teams** in the [Move customizations between environments](/powerapps/teams/import-solution-in-teams.md#export-customizations-from-dataverse-for-teams) topic. 

When selecting the customizations to export, select the bot you want to export. You can use the filter on the side navigation panel to only show bots within that team.

The chatbot will be saved into the **Downloads** folder on your PC.

## Import your bot in Teams


Follow the instructions in the section titled **Import customizations into Dataverse for Teams** in the [Move customizations between environments](/powerapps/teams/import-solution-in-teams.md#import-customizations-into-dataverse-for-teams) topic. 

Your imported bot will now appear in the Power Virtual Agents app in Teams, under the team you imported it into.
