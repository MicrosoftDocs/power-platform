# Add bot to Microsoft Teams in Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](../publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams-teams.md)



After you've built a bot, you'll want people to use it.

Now that you have published your bot, you can make your bot available to users in Microsoft Teams so you, your teammates, and the broader organization can interact with it. You need to [publish the bot at least once](publication-fundamentals-publish-channels-teams.md) before users can interact with the bot in Microsoft Teams. 

You can:
- Customize your bot's apperance in Microsoft Teams
- Install the bot for yourself in Microsoft Teams
- Share the bot's installation link with other users
- Show the bot in Microsoft Teams app store
   - Show the bot to your teammates or [shared users](admin-share-bots-teams.md) by adding it to Microsoft Teams app store **Built by your colleagues** section
   - Show the bot with the organization by submitting the bot for admin approval to be featured in the Microsoft Teams app store **Built by your org** section
- Download the pre-generated Teams app manifest to distribute it within your Microsoft Teams tenant


## Prerequisites

- [!INCLUDE [Medical and emergency usage](includes/pva-usage-limitations-teams.md)]
- [Share with users](admin-share-bots-teams.md) so they can install and chat with the bot in Microsoft Teams.
- Your organization needs to allow Microsoft Power Platform apps to be added to Microsoft Teams before you or other users can directly install the bot in Teams or find it in the **Built by your colleagues** section in the Teams app store. Work with your admin to [Manage Microsoft Power Platform apps in the Microsoft Teams admin center](/microsoftteams/manage-power-platform-apps) if it has been disabled for your organization.
- Bots that are approved for the **Built by your organization** section (after submission to an admin) are managed separately by admins in the Microsoft Teams admin center's [Manage apps page](/microsoftteams/submit-approve-custom-apps#validate).
- Before installing the bot for yourself or sharing the bot with others, you should [publish the bot at least once](publication-fundamentals-publish-channels-teams.md).

## Customize bot's appearance in Microsoft Teams
Providing the right description and appearance for the bot before making it available to other users is important as it educates them on what the bot's purpose is and its branding when applicable.

1. Go to the **Publish** tab on the side navigation pane and select **Maker available to others**.

1. Select **Edit details** to change the bot's icon, color, and descriptions. These will be shown in Microsoft Teams app store and the app's About tab after user installs it. [Review the recommendations on Microsoft Teams icon formats](/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema#icons).

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-bot-to-teams-edit-details.PNG" alt-text="You can make changes to the icon, background color, and descriptions":::


   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >Updates to the bot's detail will not apply to users who have already installed the bot via shared link or [built by your colleague section](#show-to-teammates-and-shared-users). They will need to reinstall to the bot to receive the updates.
   >Updates to the bot's detail will not apply to bots that have been approved by admin. You will need to resubmit the bot for approval to have the latest detail updated for users.

2. Select **More** to add additional information:  
    - Developer name
    - Website
    - Privacy Statement
    - Terms of use

       You should provide this information to keep your user informed about the bot. See the [Privacy statement and terms of use](publication-terms-of-use-teams.md) topic for more details and examples.

3. Select **Save** to return to the screen where you can make your bot available in Teams. You'll see your updates to the color, icon, and description are shown.

>[!NOTE]
>Icon customization in this section only applies to bot avatar for bots that are [approved by admin](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams-teams.md#show-to-the-organization) and does not apply for users who install the bot via direct [installation link](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams-teams.md#share-a-link-so-others-can-install-the-bot) or Microsoft Teams app store [Built by your colleague section](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams-teams.md#show-to-teammates-and-shared-users). You can customize bot avatar at [Customize the look and feel of the bot](customize-default-canvas-teams.md).
>:::image type="content" source="media/bot-avatar-teams.PNG" alt-text="Bot avatar icon in Teams chat.":::


## Install a bot as an app in Microsoft Teams
After you have published a bot, you can add the bot to your own version of Microsoft Teams directly from the Power Virtual Agents app.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>New content in a freshly published bot won't appear in conversations that are currently ongoing. After 30 minutes of idle time, the bot will be updated.  
>You can type *Start over* in an existing conversation to start a new conversation right away and see the latest updates to the bot.

You should add your bot to your own version of Teams before sharing it with others.

1. Go to the **Chatbot** tab.

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-chatbot-tab-on-homepage.png" alt-text="The chatbot tab is in the top navigation pane.":::

1. Open the bot you want to add.

1. On the side navigation pane, select **Publish**. 

1. Select **Open the bot** to have the installation prompt launch in Microsoft Teams. Select **Add** to have it added as an app in Teams. This only installs the bot for you.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-bot-to-teams-copy-link-teams.PNG" alt-text="Copy link from Teams availability options.":::

6. Share the copied link with users to install the bot in Microsoft Teams.


## Show the bot in Microsoft Teams app store

Once you've published your bot, you can show it in the Microsoft Teams app store so users can find and install it. 


### Show to teammates and shared users

You can share your bot by adding it to the Microsoft Teams app store, **Built for your org > **Built by your colleagues** section. Only your teammates and [shared users](admin-share-bots-teams.md) will find the bot there.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Only teammates or shared users can find and install the bot in Microsoft Teams app store Built by your colleague section. The bot will not show for everyone in the organization even if it is configured to allow everyone to use the bot. To [show the bot to organization](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams-teams.md#show-to-the-organization), submit the bot for admin's approval to show in Microsoft Teams app store Built by your org section.
>The bot can only be shown in Microsoft Teams app store **Built by your colleague** section when the total number of shared users do not excceed the tenant's Teams app store discovery policy. To show the bot beyond your organizations policy limit, partner with your admin to [show the bot to organization](#show-to-the-organization).

:::image type="content" source="media/add-bot-to-teams-bbyc-teams.PNG" alt-text="The Built by your colleagues section as at the bottom of the Built for your org section in the Teams app store.":::

1. Go to the **Chatbot** tab.

2. Open the bot you want to show in Microsoft Teams app store.

3. On the side navigation pane, select **Publish**.

4. Select **Make the bot available to others**.

5. Select **Availability options**. 

6. Select **Show to my teammates and shared users** and review who has access to the bot.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-bot-to-teams-bbyc-teams.PNG" alt-text="Show bot in Teams app store Built by your colleague section.":::

7. Confirm **Visibile in Build by your colleagues** checkbox is selected and select **Share**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-bot-to-teams-visible-in-bbyc.PNG" alt-text="Select visible in Built by your colleagues checkbox in sharing UI.":::

8. This will automatically add the bot to the **Built by your colleagues** section, and will show a green label **Added to Teams** in the availabilty options page.

:::image type="content" source="media/add-bot-to-teams-added-to-teams-teams.PNG" alt-text="The flyout shows the bot has been added to Teams.":::




>[!NOTE]
>If your app doesn't appear in the **Built by your colleagues** section, your Teams app might be caching information. 
>Try signing out and back in again (if you're using the desktop app) or refreshing your browser (if you're using the web app of Teams).



### Remove the bot from the Built by your colleagues section


You can remove the bot from showing in the **Built by your colleagues** section. This does not impact users who have already installed the bot.


1. Go to the **Chatbot** tab.

2. Open the bot you want to remove.

3. On the side navigation pane, select **Publish**.

4. Select **Make the bot available to others**.

5. Select **Availability options**. 

6. Select **Show to my teammates and shared users** and remove **Visibile in Build by your colleagues** checkbox selection. 

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-bot-to-teams-remove-bbyc.PNG" alt-text="Uncheck visible in Built by your colleagues checkbox in sharing UI.":::

5. Select **Share**. Now the bot will no longer show in Microsoft Teams app store **Built by your colleague** section.



## Show to the organization

You can share the bot with your organization by submitting your bot for admin approval to be featured in the **Built for your org > **Built by your org** section. This is a great way to broadly distribute your bot by partnering with your admin to roll out the bot to everyone in the organization or a subset of users. 


:::image type="content" source="media/add-bot-to-teams-bbyo-teams.PNG" alt-text="The Built by your org section is at the top of the Built for Org section in the Teams app store.":::


Admins can also [preinstall and pin the bot](/microsoftteams/teams-app-setup-policies) for users in the organization so they can access it directly from their left app bar in Microsoft Teams.  


Before submitting the bot to your organization, make sure:

- Your bot is ready for release and in compliance with company standards, rules and policies.
- You coordinate with your teammates: once the bot has been submitted it can't be re-submitted by a different user until the previous submission is approved or rejected by an admin.
- You have removed the bot, if applicable, from the **Built by your colleagues** section. Submitting your bot for admin approval could result in your bot showing up in two places. See the instructions on [removing your bot](#remove-the-bot-from-the-built-by-your-colleagues-section) for details. 

>[!NOTE]
>Once a bot is approved by an admin, the bot availability in the **Built by your org** section will be completely managed by your admin. Only an admin can remove the bot from the **Built by your org** section.


### Submit for the Built by your org section

1. Go to the **Chatbot** tab.

2. Open the bot you want to submit.

3. On the side navigation pane, select **Publish**.

4. Select **Make the bot available to others**.

5. Select **Availability options**. 

5. Confirm the bot is not showed to teammates or shared users. [Remove](publication-add-bot-to-microsoft-teams-teams.md#remove-the-bot-from-the-built-by-your-colleagues-section) if it says **Added to Teams**.

6. Select **Show to everyone in my org**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-bot-to-teams-show-bbyo.PNG" alt-text="Show bot to organization in Teams panel availability options.":::


7. Review the requirements for submission, and select **Submit for admin approval**.

    >[!NOTE]
    >Make sure you review the content and it's ready for an admin to review. You will need to submit new requests to the admin to [update the icon and descriptions](#customize-bots-appearance-in-microsoft-teams) for bots that were previously approved.  
    >Once approved, all new and existing users of the bot in Teams will receive the update.  
    >This only applies to the bot details. You can continue to make content updates to your bot by publishing the latest content without needing to re-submit to admin.

9. A final confirmation prompt will appear. Select **Yes** to continue. The bot will be sent to your admin [for them to approve it](/microsoftteams/submit-approve-custom-apps#validate), and you will see a note indicating the status of your submission.

    :::image type="content" source="media/publish-share-submit-status.png" alt-text="The status has an orange note with information about the status of the submission, including the name of the bot, the version number, and the current status Waiting for approval":::

    >[!NOTE]
    >After submitting the bot for admin approval, you should not change the bot's access setting to be less than everyone in your organization.
    >This will result in users in the organization unable to chat with the bot after installing it from the Microsoft Teams app store **Built by your org** section.
    >Work with your admin via [Microsoft Teams app policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-app-setup-policies) on who can find and install the bot.

10. You will need to wait for your [admin's approval](/microsoftteams/submit-approve-custom-apps).  You can check the latest status by selecting **Refresh**, or opening the **Make the bot available to others** window from the **Publish** page.

11. After your admin approves the bot, the status will be updated to **Approved**. You can directly open the bot and share the approved version's link with other users.

12. Optionally partner with your admin to pre-pin or install the app for users via [Microsoft Teams app policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/MicrosoftTeams/teams-app-setup-policies) so they can find the bot directly in their Microsoft Teams left app rail.

>[!NOTE]
>If your app doesn't appear in the **Built by your org** section even though it's marked as **Approved**, your Teams app might be caching information. 
>Try signing out and back in again (if you're using the desktop app) or refreshing your browser (if you're using the Teams web app).

## Download the bot's Teams app manifest (advanced)

You can download the bot's Teams app manifest to make detail changes to the manifest directly and share with your admin or users in the tenant. You can also directly upload the app manifest into Microsoft Teams if your organization's policy allows you to [upload custom applications](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/deploy-and-publish/apps-upload).


1. Go to the **Chatbot** tab.

2. Open the bot you want to download.

3. On the side navigation pane, select **Publish**.

4. Select **Make the bot available to others**.

5. Select **Availability options**. 
 
7. Select **Download .zip**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-bot-to-teams-download-zip.png" alt-text="Download Teams app manifest zip file from Teams panel availability options.":::

9. The manifest will be generated as a .zip file, and will be saved according to your browser's save settings.


## Uninstall the bot from the side navigation bar

You can remove the bot from your list of apps if you no longer want to use it. This doesn't delete the bot from the Power Virtual Agents app, it just means you can't chat with the bot in Microsoft Teams.

1. Right-click the bot's app icon.

2. Select **Uninstall** and then select **Uninstall**.

   ![Uninstall the bot.](media/channel-teams-delete-channel-teams.png)

## Disconnect your bot from Teams

You can take your bot offline so users can no longer chat with the bot in Teams. This means the bot won't respond to anyone who tries to chat with it, and will disrupt anyone who is using the bot. You should thoroughly consider the need to disconnect your bot before you do so.

Bots no longer show in the Microsoft Teams app store **Built by your colleague** section or be able to install it from the shared link. Bots that are added by users in Microsoft Teams will continue to exist until the user [uninstalls the bot](#uninstall-the-bot-from-the-side-navigation-bar).

For bots that are approved by admin, the bots will continue to be shown in the Microsoft Teams app store **Built by your org** section. You will need to contact your admin to remove the bot


1. Go to the **Chatbot** tab.

1. Open the bot you want to disconnect.

1. On the side navigation pane, select **Publish**.

1. Select **Make the bot available to others**.

1. Select **Disconnect from Teams**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/add-bot-to-teams-disconnect-teams.PNG" alt-text="Disconnect Teams channel in Teams channel panel.":::

1. Review the information about disconnecting your bot, and select **Disconnect** to continue.

You can always reconnect your bot after disconnecting by selecting **Turn on Teams** in the **Make the bot available to others** window on the **Publish** page.



## Known limitations
- Currently only the **Personal** scope is supported for Microsoft Teams, so users can only have a private conversation with the bot.
- [Setting the bot avatar icon](customize-default-canvas-teams.md) from side navigation pane **Manage** > **Details** will not show up for bots that are approved by an admin. Bots approved by an admin will use the app icon as the bot avatar.
- Teams has [rate limiting](/microsoftteams/platform/concepts/bots/rate-limit) on bots. Depending on your business needs, you might want to keep your bot content concise for bots that are added to Microsoft Teams.
- Disconnecting your bot might take a few minutes before the bot becomes unreachable by users on Microsoft Teams.
