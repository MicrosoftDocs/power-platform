# View billed sessions for Power Virtual Agents in Teams

Select the version of Power Virtual Agents you're using here:

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
>
> - [Power Virtual Agents web app](../analytics-billed-sessions.md)
> - [Power Virtual Agents app in Microsoft Teams](analytics-billed-sessions-teams.md)

When you purchase a Power Virtual Agents license, you gain capacity for the specified number of billed sessions. Power Virtual Agents pools this capacity across the entire tenant.

For more information about reviewing billed session analytics, see the [Power Virtual Agents web app version of this topic](../analytics-billed-sessions.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Sessions that use the [embedded test chat](authoring-test-bot-teams.md) or that only leverage capabilities included with the Power Virtual Agents for Microsoft Teams plan don't count toward the billed sessions.
> The Billed Session report doesn't distinguish between the sessions included in the Power Virtual Agents for Microsoft Teams plan and those that are not. You might see an inflated number of billed sessions in the report.

## Known issues

- We've recently introduced the capability for selected Microsoft 365 subscriptions to deploy bots to Microsoft Teams. The Power Virtual Agents analytics dashboards haven't been updated to reflect this change.
