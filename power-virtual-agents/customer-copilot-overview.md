# Create copilots for customer engagement and hand off

[!INCLUDE[pva-rebrand](includes/pva-rebrand.md)]

You can create copilots to interact with your customers and integrate with customer service and customer engagement hubs. 

Customer copilots provide your customers with generative-AI-based self-help. The copilot can answer questions and provide information from what's on your company website, within files you upload, or from your knowledge base sources. 

When necessary, the customer can be escalated to a live agent with integrated hand off to the customer engagement hub that you already use, including Dynamics 365 Customer Service, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Live Person, and Genesys.

First, you'll need to create a copilot with generative AI, and tell it where it should look for information it can use when interacting with your customer. The copilot will use that information to determine the best answer or response to the user's question and return the information in a conversational tone.

Once you've created and tested your copilot, you can configure integration between the copilot and your engagement hub, including hand off to a live agent.

## Create a copilot and connect it to your knowledge source

If you haven't create copilots in Copilot Studio before, follow the steps in the [Quickstart guide for building copilots with generative AI](nlu-gpt-quickstart.md).

If you already have a copilot that you've built with Power Virtual Agents or Copilot Studio, you can go straight to the instructions for [adding a generative answers node](nlu-boost-node.md) to connect your copilot to your data.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>  
> Generative AI features won't work in "classic" chatbots. A classic chatbot will be marked as such in the list of copilots in Copilot Studio. These are chatbots made with older versions of Microsoft Copilot Studio and its predecessor, Power Virtual Agents. If it's labelled as a copilot then generative AI features will work.
